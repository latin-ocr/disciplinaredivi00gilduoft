PREFACE.

HE design of the following pages is to
present an outline of private study for
youths leaving school. The writer has desired
to put into form the suggestions which a tutor
is often called upon to give his pupils on
sending them out into the world. It is hoped
that this volume may prove of use as a sup-
plement to his farewell charge.

An additional and extraordinary stimulus
has been given to individual exertion by the
increasing strictness of government examina-
tionSâ€š as a real test of competency, and the
admirable arrangements which have been
adopted with respect to the Indian Civil Ser-
vice appointmentS. Youths are thus thrown
more than ever upon their own mental re-
sourceS, and it becomes their interest to en-
deavour by every means in their power to
retrace the lines and features of their past
school discipline.
