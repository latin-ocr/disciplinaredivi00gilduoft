account of so much waste intellectual talent ; hence,
also, the ignorance which prevails as to the true
principles of education in the minds of people
generally.

To take an example of perhaps the greatest de-
gree of mental deprivation resulting from these
causes, we will consider the case of the ‘⁶ well-to-
do” yeoman. He leaves school, say at fourteen or
fifteen. Rating his stock of knowledge at its
highest probable measure, we may fairly presume
that he has not travelled further along the road of
learning, than to have come within easy distance
of the fair domain of letters. Having got so far,
the generality of men turn back. Of course he
must, under any circumstances, spend most of his
time in at least directing the course of out-door
labour. We are not about to recommend seden-
tary habits to the farmer3 but what we design to
show is, that the intelligent boy of fifteen ought
not, as a matter of course, to content himself with
the fruitless fact of just so much book-learning,
just so much classical or scientific learning even,
as he may have acquired during his six or seven
years at the grammar-school—as if that, indeed,
were but dead weight, cumbering his hrain, and
with which, in fact, it had better never have been
freighted: but that he ought to regard these acr
quirements as so much seed sown in faith of a
coming harvest—as so much virgin ore, wherewith
to compare the metal that may be given him for
gold, when he can no longer refer it to the judg-
ment of the assayer.
