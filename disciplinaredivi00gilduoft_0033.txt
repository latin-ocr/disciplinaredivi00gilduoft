Accuracy of observation, a faculty of discrimina-
tion, an enlarged and instinctive memory—these
are real, living, working powers, and they may be
secured by any one who having had a good and
judicious school-training will carry into the next
stage of life the discipline which it is our purpose
to suggest. After a meal there rightly comes a
period of digestion. We cannot too much insist
upon this plain analogy. Now the quiet time for
thought that may be seized by any one even during
the period of his introduction to his profession, is
such an interval of digestion. Let the time go by
without this maryin of voluntary discipline, self-
recollection, converse with wisdom—call it what
you will—it can hardly ever be redeemed. It
costs too much afterwards. It is like the principle

to the town, and had in their youth all the advantages of
, a sturdy and manful hill-side or sea-side training3 men
whose bodies were developed‚ and their lungs fed on pure
breezes, long before they brought to work in the city the
bodily and mental strength which they had gained by loch
and moor. But it is not so with their sons. Their busi-
ness habits are learnt in the counting-house 3 a good school,
doubtless as far as it goes: but one which will expand
none but the lowest intellectual faculties 3 which will make
them accurate accountants, shrewd computers and compe·
titors, but never the originators of daring schemes, men
able and willing to go forth to replenish the earth and to sub-
due it ..... What is needed in these cases is a methodio
and scientific habit of mind3 and a class of objects on
which to exercise that habit, which will fever neither the
speculative intellect nor the moral sense, and those phy-

sical scienoe will give as nothing else can give it.''—Kings·
ley’s Glaucus.
