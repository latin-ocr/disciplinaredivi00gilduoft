placed before them—men who are ready and
thouykfful‚ who can grasp all the bearings of any
transaction that may be submitted to them, by
virtue of an instinctive power of subordination,
who whilst they will do drudgery as well as mere
stipendiaries because of a habit of labour and of
attention which is second nature with them, are
all the while learning, by self-discipline and by
the exercise of their powers upon adequate sub-
jects, to be something more than workmen‚ some—
thing more than clerks of a single department, to
be in fact τοιοῦτοι in relation to an ever-widening
range of responsibilities—men whose depth of mind
and steady advancement will be a warrant against
undue ambition, but who aspire to qualg'ij them-
selves for the very highest offices of government—
men who are the product not of teaching but of

the administrative ability of the candidate. On what, then,
does administrative ability depend ? It depends on certain
faculties of the mind3 but these are the very saculties
which a good general examinatiou is most likely to detect.
For such purposes, however, it is obvious that the range
of inquiry should be broad, and that no incidental consi-
derations should be suffered to narrow it. The object is
not so much to discover whether a man knows this or that
fact, as whether he possesses such powers of mind as would
qualify him for all the various exigencies of administrative
duty. Here lies the justification for examining the candi-
dates in subjects bearing to all appearance no great reference
to the profession in view· These subject-s yield the best
known measure of general capacity, and general capacity
gives the best promise of those faculties of which we are
in search.''-Times, Oct. 15, 1855.
