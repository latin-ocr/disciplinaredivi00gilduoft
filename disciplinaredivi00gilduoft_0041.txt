subject, to those who wish to go thoroughly into
the matter, is invaluable. We will mention that
the advice of the writer is, “ to throw away all
notes,” taking the Oxford edition of Bishop Lloyd,
as being the best for text, punctuation, paragraph-
divisions, references, type, si'ze,-and to make St.
Paul his own paraphrast, by reading his epistles
“ through as a whole and in this form,” so as to
see the force of “ those breathless parentheses'’
(such as Ephes. iii. 2—-14, and on again to iv. 1),
and so as to trace those ‘⁶ connections, transitions,
and resumptions, which would require many a
verbose note to trace and explain, ...... by their
own lzykt.”

We have not yet alluded to Hebrew as a possible
attainment of the yoimg scholar, although we are
aware that the rudiments of this language are
taught in some schools. It is most desirable of
course that an acquirement so valuable should be
kept up and improved upon 3 but on the wholeit will
be a question with most tutors, whether all the time
(for the study of languages) that can be spared from
Latin and Greek, must not perforce be devoted to
the living tongues. Where the student then does
not know anything of the original language of the
Old Testament Scriptures, and has no inclination
to set about it, we would recommend the perusal of
the Septuagint version, not indeed as a substitute
for the Hebrew text, but “ for the variety of the

ways in which its language throws light on that of
the New Testament.”
