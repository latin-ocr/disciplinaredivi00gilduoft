26 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

not an Athanase‚ and cannot confront a world3
but, in the particular sphere of Holy Scripture I
may, perhaps, be permitted to say, that if we would
train our younger students to be reverential think-
ers, earnest Christians, and sound Divines, we
must habituate them,to a patient and thoughtful
study of the words and language of Scripture, be-
fore we allow them to indulge in an exegesis for
which they are immature and incompetent. 1f
the Scriptures are divinely inspired, then surely it
is a young man's noblest occupation‚ patiently and
lovingly to note every change of expression, every
turn of language, every variety of inflexion‚ to
analyze and to investigate, to contrast and to com-
pare, until he has obtained some accurate know-
ledge of those outward elements which are per-
meated by the inward influence and powers of the
Holy Spirit of God. As he wearisomely traces
out the subtle distinctions that underlie some illa·
tive particle, or characterize some doubtful prepo-
sition, let him cheer himself with the reflection
that every effort of thought he is thus enabled to
make, is (with God's blessing) a step towards the
inner shrine, a nearer approach to a recognition
of the thoughts of an Apostle, yea, a less dim per-
ception of the mind of Christ.

“ No one who feels deeplynpon the subject of
inspiratiom will allow himself to be beguiled into
an indifference to the mysterious interest that at-

taches itself to the very grammar of the N ew
Testament.'’
