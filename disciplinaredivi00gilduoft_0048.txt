28 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

Ackermann's “ N umismatic Illustrations of the
N arrative portions of the N ew Testament,” is a
most useful and interesting contribution to Bibli-
cal inquiry.

Again‚ if you have a taste for historical inquiry,
and have been taught something of the mode in
which points of historical nicety are made out, you

Oriental customs, diction, style (with which we mostly be·
come familiar through the medium of the Arabian Nights
or other equally veracious ‘ entertainments'), throw over
au a halo of romanoe, which produoes a kind of vague im-
pression, such as the parables leave on the mind of a child.
In fact, the outlines require to be strengthened, in order
that we may think and Judge of men and things as they
really were. Familiarity with the mamers and eustoms
of the East‚ so much less liable to change than our own,—
such a familiarity as could alone be acquired by travel. or
rather by a residence in Syria—would of course be the best
and surest method of supplying the desideratum. But
‘ non cuivis homini contingit.> The few who have the
opportunity are much to be envied: and they are laid
under a strong obligation to observe carefully and report
faithfully, without disparagement on the one hand, or ex-
aggeration on the other, whatever may serve to the eluci·
dation of Scripture truth3 for the great majority of Chris-
tians must of necessity look to books for information 011
the subject, and the more familiar we become with the
geography and scenery of Palestine, and with the habits of
native life, the juster conceptions we shall form of the
public or private events recorded in the inspired books.
We shall thus learn to regard the Patriarchs, Prophets‚
and Apostles as men, ‘ subject to like passions as we are 3 ³
they will no longer be the dim ideal beings that they are
to most of us3 unsubstantial, phantom-like forms, flitting
over the page of sacred history, like painted figures on the
illuminated disc of a magio-lantern.''—-Christian Remem-
branc-er, April, 1848, pp. 430, 431. ‘
