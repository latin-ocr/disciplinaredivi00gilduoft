to rise from the perusal of the Horae Paulinae
without a full conviction of the authenticity of St.
Paul's Epistles.'' The discipline (ff mind en·-
gendered by a careful perusal of this matchless
work is singularly helpful to those who are anxious
to acquire the faculty of just and accurate criticism
in the study of the Scriptures.

There are many sources of illustration which
will naturally suggest themselves to one engaged
in sacred studies. Geology, botany, natural history,
architectum, numismatology-all of these have
important evidence to yield in direct or indirect
support of revelation and the Subsequent order of
God’s providence in His chureh. Itis not needful
to speak of each of these subjects by itself. So much
has been done of late years to subsidize the several
sciences‚ and to make indifferent researches pay
tribute to the truth of Holy Scriptum, that books
on all these subjects abound. Amongst others we
may mention Hugh Miller’s ‘⁶ Footprints of the
Creator,’'——-Hitchcock's ‘⁶ Religion of Geology,''—-
“ Sacred Streams” by Mr. Gosse‚-—Mr. Morris’s
‘⁴ Natural History of the Bible,''—Sedgewick’s
“ Discourses,''—Archbishop Sumner's ‘⁶ Records
of Creation,'’ and some of the later publications of
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

A work by Mr. Stanley on “ Sinai and Pales-
tine'' has been welcomed by the “ unanimous voice
of approval.” ‘⁴ The accomplished author,’' says
an able reviewer, ‘⁶ has done more to illustrate the
geography of Scripture than any extant writer.
