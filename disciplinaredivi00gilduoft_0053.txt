Mr. Trench has edited a volume of Mediaeval
Hymns (Latin). Under such guidance these very

earlier and heathen, and the later and Christian
art'’ as well as ⁶⁶ concerning the difference between
the spirit of the Latin poetry of the Christian church‚
and that of the elder or heathen poetry of Rome.''

Closely allied to sacred poetry is Alleyory, a
vehicle of instruction sanctioned by the constant
usage of scripture and of the greatest power when
wielded by the few qualified for the task. It must
not be forgotten that Bishop Patrick’s ‘⁶ Pilgrim”
was written before Bunyan’s inimitable allegory.
The Bishop of Oxford and Mr. Adams and Mr.
Monro are known as the principal contributors‚ of

young and old alike.
