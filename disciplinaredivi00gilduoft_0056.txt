As a general rule, with respect to history and
that branch of history with which the strongest
feelings and' the weightiest interests are associated,
we would recommend the study of orzyinal docu-
ments, where these may be had. Let a period
speak for itself, let the authoritative decisions of the
Church or any body of Christians be received as the
opinion or the faith of such. In order to deter-
mine what was the prevailing belief upon any point,
examine the liturgies, creeds and confessions in
s which that belief found its most lively expression.
Histories always are to a certain extent partial;
this is a condition of humanity, not a fault of in-
dividuals. But let the bias and ‘ stand-point' of
an historian be ascertained. Besides, historians

’ are liable to make blunders, and are not at all times

able or diligent enough to submit their impression
or their favourite theories to a sufficient test.

they often make themselves ridiculous ..... And there is
at the present day a new and additional reason for desiring
every member of the Church to be tolerably well instructed
in her previous fortunes. SubJects of the last importance
to the Christian, questions which affect the position of a
churchman in this country, are being opened up afresh,
and submitted to the decision of public opinion .......
Hence we believe the Church of England to be in a great
strait, and we urge and entreat every son and daughter of
our beloved Mother to acquaint themselves with the mis-
fortunes she has gone through, her constancy in trouble,
her purity of doctrine, and her providential protection up
to this day : that they may be enabled with knowledge,
and on conviction, to withstand their adversaries, ‘ and
having done all, to stand.² '²
