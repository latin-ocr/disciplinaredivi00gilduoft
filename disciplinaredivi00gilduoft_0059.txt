mould of antiquity, but which none the less> demand
the ready advocacy of those, who, at least through
the newspapers, if not in parliament itself, might
from time to time correct unfair and incomplete
statements of an historical character, tending greatly
to influence the decision of such questions as the
revival of convocation, or the like—statements,
which are better met by laymen than by the clergy,
even if the latter were more generally in the way
of observing them. But we shall have more to
say hereafter on some kindred duties, which we
conceive to be peculiarly incumbent on young men
now-a-days. When we come to speak of history,
the opportunity will occur for some introductory
remarks of this character, and we hope then briefly
to consider the political aspect of that scheme of
education which we are advocating.

Meanwhile it must be borne in mind that we
are addressing a wide circle, including young men
of more or less learned leisure, of varying resources,
of different professions or callings in life—-those
who bring with them from Eton, or Harrow, or
Winchester, considerable powers of scholarship, or
those who, having been educated at schools of less
repute, may still be equally competent to profit by
the hints that are here thrown out—those who are
engaged in mercantile pursuits or in the army (we
have our ownv notions under this head, which we
will not forget to broach in a Subsequent chapter),
or in agriculture, the expectant squire, or the sub—
stantial yeoman.
