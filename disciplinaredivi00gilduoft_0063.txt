SACRED s'runms. 43

“ Izaak Walton’s Lives‚'’ Anderdon’s ‘⁶ Life of
Bishop Ken,” ‘⁶ Two Lives of N icholas Ferrar,”
just edited by Mr. Mayor (Macmfflan), ‘⁶ Will-
mott’s Life of Bishop Taylor,’' ‘⁶ Kettlewell’s Life,'’
compiled from the collections of Dr. George Hickes
and Robert NeIson‚ Esq.‚ ‘⁶ The Autobiography
of Bishop Patrick,” “ Bishop Bull's Life,” “ Mr.
Suckh'ng's Life, by Isaac Williams‚” and many
others which might be named. Perhaps there is
no subject of study more conducive to the formation
of a manly Christian character than that wherein
the memories of the great and good lie embalmed.
Biography, to individuals, is the most instructive
branch of history.

To those who have entered into the spirit of
these remarks, we need scarcely add a caution as
to the temper to be observed in treading' upon
holy ground. Our scheme implies that spirit of
active devotion which reaches to the intellect as
well as to the beart—which aims at ‘⁶ the wisdom
that is from above,’' through the discipline of purity Ι
and peaceableness and gentleness—-which‚ seeking
to return the one or the two or the five talents
with usury, is ever busy, ever gathering strength
aud comeliness.
