we require of him is that he shall be able to relish
the atmosphere of that region, through which our
route to Parnassus lies, and be prepared, if need
be, to take his seat beside us with a steady brain,
in some mountain nook commanding a distant re-
trospect of the Boeotian plains. If he have no
interest in the fertile vales of Hellas, we cannot
ask him to lay out capital in any speculative ven—
ture. At the same time, we think that the seven
or eight years’ occupation of the land ought to have
yielded him sufficient income to enable him to ac-
quire a permanent interest in some one or other
of its allotments.

But we are not attempting to vindicate the gene-
ral prosecution of classicai studies, What we
desire is simply to reiterate the question—whether
you, who now possess the key to the storehouse of
old-world wisdom, to ‘⁴ a rich garden of study,''
will suffer it to rust, or whether you will let it still
hang on the ring along with those appliances of
„ learning which you must always carry about with
you—whether, possessing now the medium of ac-
cess, we might call it the masonic sign of appeal to
those old worthies of the Greek calendar of wis-
dom and of heroism, you will tacitly drop their ac-
quaintance, even if you should not have the heart
deliberately to “ break with’' them. This is the
question: it is one, not of setting about or of leav-
ing alone, but of holding or of letting drop—not
a question of making a new reservoir, but of look-
ing to the repair of one already with much toil dug
