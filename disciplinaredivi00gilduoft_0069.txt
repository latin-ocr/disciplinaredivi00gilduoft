tudeS, and the longitudes of every other place in
the world of letters* which at any Subsequent time

bring about in New Testament study in the original, is
not, by any means, to discourage breadth and variety of
research, but to secure that depth and solidity on which
alone these can safely be based. Illustrative reading pre·
supposes something to be illustrated3 collateral reading,
some principa] line for it to run parallel to 3 and that some-
thing must be a rightly-directed, methodical, and critical
study of the sacred text in the original. Let this be forth-
coming, and stand firmly up as the stamen, the ‘ warp' of
the web of theological study, and there is no limit to the
amount of subtemen, ‘ woof' of every texture and colour‚
which may with advantage be worked into it. All that is
then needed, is discrimination in the choice of materials.
Here, then, will come in with admirable effect, the results
of all chance and occasional theological reading, such as
every student must more or less heled into. The writings
of Fathers, however unsystematically and pro re -ηιιτά
studied, wffl now render up ample and available illustra-
tion, for we shall know where to place it. And our perusal
of later works will teem with precious fragments of criti-
cism in like manner, not now floating vaguely and without
purpose, but ever tending towards one central line, and
forming and crystallizing about it. The habit of noting
and recording such illustrative passages cannot be too
highly commended: an interleaved copy of the Greek text
supplies the readiest means of carrying it into practice.
By this means, the student will find after a while, that, in
George Herbert'mrords, ‘ he hath compiled a book, a body
of divinity,' and will fully acknowledge the truth of what
the same revered though quaint authority adds on the
subJect, viz„ ‘ that though the world is full of such com-
-posures, yet every man’s own is fittest and readiest and
most savoury to him.' ”

various accumulations of human knowledge are-not so many
detached masses. They are all connected parts of one great
