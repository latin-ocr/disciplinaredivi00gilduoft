GREEK ΛΝΒ LATm. 59

and our civilization, like that of Gallia, is of
Roman original. Thus two countries, whose shores
stand face to face with ever threatening aspect''
(written 1852), “ the two most powerful nations
in the world, were tamed and tutored by the
Romans. The Gaul has repaid his instructor, in
modern times, by many a terrible visit, as he used
to do before Caesar put him in chains. The Briton
has been made almost another man since the Roman
left him.”

We shall not be likely at any time to apologize
for quoting from this writer; but we may say
generally, on the point of frequent, and varied, and
at times, lengthy quotation, that our aim is to mul-
tiply authorities in support of the several parts of
our scheme, and to adopt whatever suggestions we
may find scattered here and there in books, con-
tent if the links of continuation pass muster re-
spectably, rather than to attempt to say, as if at
first hand, what, even if equally well said, would
be accepted simply on its own merits, and without
the additional and justifi able advantage of authority.
For the liberty thus taken we once for all crave
indulgence.

To return,—-were it only that our scheme in-
volves a review of past labours, of past success, of
past failures, independently of the interest attach-
ing to such a retrospect, it would be the best as-
surance of future success, as well as of increasing
care and diligence in conducting labours of a

kindred nature. We shall speak of this review
