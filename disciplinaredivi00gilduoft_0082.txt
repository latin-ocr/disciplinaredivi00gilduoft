62 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

just at the critical time of a man's life, and con-
tinued until it has had time really to form his
mind to the practice of careful study, corrects the
natural tendency to a desultory habit, and gives
him an after power, of which he can never fully
estimate the value. We might, indeed, charac-
terize our present design as an attempt to supply,
through aided self-discipline, the want of a more
systematic culture during those four or five import-
ant years between boyhood and manhood.

Cedric Oldacre tells us of ‘⁶ the last of the old
squires‚” that he “ saw clearly that the want of a
college education must be made up for by a strict
self-discipline, and he took good care that nothing
should be wanting on his part.'' (P. 23.) What
we wish to secure for our young friends is the con-
tinuance of the habitos learning on the same care-
ful system as that pursued at the higher schools,
in contradistinction to that indifference and for-
getfulness of the past which seems to befall so
many minds on emerging from the atmosphere of
compulsory discipline. On this ground it is that
we consider it so important not to abandon the
medium of instruction furnished by classica] studies,*
as being that wherein a familiarity with intellec-
tual pursuits has been attained. By this means
we would bridge over the dark stream of self-will
which rushes between the kingdoms of compulsory
and voluntary discipline. For this short passage

* “ Abeunt studia in moreS.”
