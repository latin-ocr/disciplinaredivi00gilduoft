GREEK ΛΝΒ ῙιΔΤῙΝ. 63

in the troublesome journey of life we offer our-
selves as in some sort a guide, thinking, even thus
far, that the handrail of intellectual aid is not an
unbecoming adjunct to the solid framework of
moral and religious guidance.

Having stated our view of this after-education,
it may not be without use to indicate some points
in that higher system of education which we con—
ceive that the course of study here prescribed ought
in some degree to resemble, as being intended to
occupy the human mind during the same period
of its development. We think that our young
friend ought, at least, to understand the scope and

and I think we have done well. But our ancient studies
remain, and still appear to many a relic of barbarism. ”
Now, I cannot enter at length into the defence of the sys-
tem,—all I wish to do at present is to explain its meaning.
It is principally a system of exereise for the mental facul-
ties, but it is also a study of the elementary portions of the

which gives us the fundamental positions of human law
and civil society3 and the history of Greece, which gives
us the early development of man’s intellect and philosophi-
cal observation. We study all these, with contemporary
literature enough to open to us the very life of the men of
whom we read, and who were forming prospectively the
elements of the society in which we now live, and of the
