proving the taste,” and of understanding our own
language, and has shown very fully to how large
an extent* the edifice of modern phraseology,†—-

⁴· ‘⁶ Suppose the English language to be divided into a
hundred parts3 of these, to make a rough distribution,
sixty would be saxon, thirty would be Latin (including of
course the Latin which has come to us through the French*),
five would be Greek3 ..... leaving the other five, per-
haps too large a residue, to be divided among all the other
languages from which we have adopted isolated words.''—

“ One sufficient reason why we should occupy ourselves
with the past of our language is, because the present is
only intelligible in the light of the past, often of a very
remote past indeed.''—English.· Past and Present, p. 5.

† “ The Latin may contribute its tale of bricks, yea, of
goodly and polished hewn stones, to the spiritual building,''
&c.—Trench.

* Mr. Trench gives a valuable rule for determining
whether a word of Latin origin has come to us “ directly
from the Latin,'' “ or only mediately from it, and to us di-
rectly from the French.'' “ It is this‚—that if a word be
directly from the Latin, it will not have undergone any
alteration or modification in its form and shape, save only
as respects the termination ;—‘ innocentia’ will have become
‘ innocency,' ‘ natio' will have become ‘ nation,' ‘ firma-
mentum ' will have become ‘ firmament,' but nothing more.
On the other hand, if it comes through the French, it will
generally be considerably altered in its passage. It will
have undergone a species of lubrication 3 its sharply-defined
Latin outline will in good part have departed from it3 thus
‘ crown' is from ‘ corona,' but through ‘ couronne,' and
itself a dissyllable, ‘ coroune,' in our earlier English3
‘ treasure' is from ‘ thesaurus,’ but through ‘ tresor 3 '
‘ emperor' is the Latin ‘ imperator,' but it was first ‘ em-
pereur.' ’'-Pp. 10, 11.
