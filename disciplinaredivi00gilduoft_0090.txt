logy, in common parlances* in the scientific inter-
communication of nations, in short, in all its
departments,—-is built up of Greek and Latin
elements, compounded and re-compounded to suit
the exigences of our complex modern systems.
The most important caution to be urged in an
introduction to classical study is thus alluded to
by a writer already quoted ε “ One whose business
it is to be conversam: with a heathen literature can
hardly fail to be sensible of his need of that purity
without which nothing is holy‚ as well as of that
power without which nothing is strong.’' We will
go on to say, that that accident of classical study
which a man of high character as a University
professor deems thus worthy of sels-directed caution,
ought to be the ground of serious question with
those of less firmly-established principle. There
are foul blots on the page of heathen learning, and
nowhere more than on that part which is most
likely to be chosen as a subject of study by those
whom we are addressing,—their poetry. We
question whether it be well to remove these blots
before presenting their writings even to boys. But
we will here add a word of plain-spoken advice,

* “ Greek and Latin words also we continue to adopt,
although now not any longer in masseS‚ but only one by
one. With the lively interest which aIways has been felt
in classical studies among us, and which will continue to
be felt, so long as any greatness and nobleness survive in our
land, it must needs be that accessions from these quarters
would never cease altogether.''-English, 85⁶. pp. 46, 47.
