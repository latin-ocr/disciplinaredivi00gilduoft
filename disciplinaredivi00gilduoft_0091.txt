—it was in order to “ make clean men’s hearts
within them'' that the Gospel was given, and a
“ fountain for uncleanness” was opened in the
heart of a nation under the dominion of‘ Pagan
Rome. If there be disfigurements in Greek and
Roman poets and historians and philosophers,
what is to be said of books which, written in a
year of grace, repeat and reproduce, in still more
loathsome forms, that very evil which it was the
object of Christianity once and for ever to destroy2
The noting and right judgment of such blots in
heathen literature, it may be, will best prepare for
the ulter repudiation of deliberate impurity in books,
written (pro scelus J) by and on behalf of men call-
ing themselves Christians! It is, after all, in men's
own hearts that the evil to be dreaded resides.
The discipline must be applied there. A man will
get no harm from the improper allusions of heathen
authors, if he take them up as only a Christian
may. Better that he ‘⁶ pluck out the right eye''
