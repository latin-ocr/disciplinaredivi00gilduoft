‘⁶ These inestimable advantages, which no
modern skill can wholly counterpoise, are known
and felt by the scholar alone. He has not failed,
in the sweet and silent studies of his youth, to
drink deep at those sacred fountains of all that is
just and beautiful. The thoughts and the words
of the master-spirits of Greece and of Rome are
inseparably blended in his memory ; a sense of
their marvellous harmonies, their exquisite fitness,
their consummate polish, has sunk for ever in his
beart, and thence throws out light and fragrancy
upon the gloom and annoyances of his maturer
years. No avocations of professional labour will
make kim abandon their wholesome study ; in the
midst of a thousand cares he will find an bour to
rec-ur to his hoyi-sk Iessons—to re-peruse them in the
pleasurable eonsciousness of old associatz'ons, and in
tlze clearness of manly judyment, and to apply them
to himself and to the world with superior profit.
The more extended his sphere of learning in the
literature of modern Europe, the more deeply,
though the more wisely, will he reverence that of
classical antiquity 3 and in declining age, when the
appetite for magazines, and reviews, and the ten-
times repeated trash of the day, has failed, he will
retire, as it were, within a circle of schoolfellow
friends, and end his secular studies, as he began
them, with his Homer, his Horace, and his .

ν Shakespeare.'’
