78 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

to turn it over and over again in your mind ; to
sift and examine it in a way which nothing short
of this would enable you to compass.* We might
quote “ Friends in Council’' as to the benefit
which the said sister would derive from such a
companionship in her brother’s studies, but we
leave the passage to be hunted for through that
most charming of books.

We can of course only imperfectly illustrate
what we mean by this episode of analytical labour,
which we think should form the preliminary dis-
cipline of those who wish to keep alive their clas-
sical learning. A single suggestion must serve as
a key to the kind of exercise which we think
necessary.

To speak on the one point of dependent sen-
tences, it seems to us that a greater familiarity
with the modes of grammatical construction would
be attained by such a practice as the following :—
Take any classical author, e. 9. Caesar3 go through
a page of the text, stripping each sentence of its
dependencies, and reducing it, as far as may be,
to a single proposition. Observe carefully, as you
go on, the full sense of the entire passage in ques-
tion, and then, taking the paper on which these
simple sentences have been written, mark precisely
on what word or words the additional matter hangs.

'² The true teacher is always the readiest learner. The
shifting of points of observation acts with a stereoscopic in-
fluence upon the mass of knowledge thus dealt with, and
the observer’s faculty in relation to it is at once doubled.
