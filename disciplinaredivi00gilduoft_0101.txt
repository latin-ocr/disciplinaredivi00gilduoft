rendering of English into Latin and Greek are
among the best products of a classical discipline,
and are products which can scarcely be supplied
by any other. Not that we think it advisable to
substitute even the most careful practice of clas-
sical composition for the direct study of English
composition, as such, but, as obliging to a rigid
’ consideration of the subject matter of the compo-
sition, we think the occasional exercise of transla-
tion and retranslation an invaluable resource. By
this means the student's attention is directed to the
niceties of language, and accuracy in small and tell-
ing points is kept in view. Such an exercise is not
unworthy of accompanying the practice of original
English composition, even in the case of those who
have long ceased to have recourse to such aids.
Terseness and force, as well 38 simplicity of ex-
pression, are to be gained only by constant prac-
tice in composition. One suggestion we may add
on this point. It is this: accustom yourself to
make abstracts in writing of what you read. Let
these aim at briefly but exactly conveying the sense
of the passage in question. When you have re-
vised your abstract‚ then translate the passage thus
abridged into Latin or Greek. This will have
the effect of impressing the process of analysis upon
your mind, in a way which will not be without its
effect upon your general style, in whatever kind
of composition you may be engaged. Whether it
be a military despatch‚ or a letter of ordinary busi-
ness, or a report of a meeting from a secretary’s
