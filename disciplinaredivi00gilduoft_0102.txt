82 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

pem—no matter‚—your work will be compact,
graceful, and to the point.

We will not do more than suggest the continued
practice of versification in Latin and Greek. As
an amusement, and also perhaps as a source of
readiness and variety of expression, we think it
might not unprofitably occupy an occasional leisure
hour. Some boys go from a public school to busi-
ness or into the army, whose skill in this kind of
composition may be considered to rank as some-
thing more than an accomplishment. Here again
we have in mind the value of these attainments as
an arm of family education. We would have the
youth husband the resources which a higher edu-
cation has put into his hands. Let him keep his
hold on them at least till he is old enough to judge
of their permanent interest and value. His
younger brother will be glad, it may be, of an
occasional coaching in Elegiacs during the holidays,
if it be volunteered in the way in which a boy only
can acceptably volunteer such services. Gratitude
to a kind father might also prompt such brotherly
acts of helpfulness. Verbum sat.

On the thorough and loving study of certain
classical authors (we are aware that some acquaint-
ance with Caesar is a requisite in the routine of mili-
taryschools) as a specific preparation for the army,
we will transcribe some remarks from the preface
to Mr. Long's matchless edition of Caesar, at the
same time that we commend the careful perusal
of the whole.
