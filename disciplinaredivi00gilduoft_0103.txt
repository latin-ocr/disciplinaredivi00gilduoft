GREEK ΛΝΒ LA'riN. 83

‘⁶ It has always been supposed by the French
writers on ancient military affairs—Folard and
others—that there is a good deal to be learned
from the Greeks and Romans. Indeed, it would
be strange if the conquerors of the world had not
left us something in this kind worth studying.
The Romans have taught us a great deal about
civil administration, and about roads, canals,
bridges, aqueducts‚ and draining3 to which we
may add farming,—both the cultivation of land
and the management of stock. They taught law
to the nations of Europe after they had beaten
them 3 and 1 assume that modern military science
is to be derived from the Romans.”

‘⁶ The man who broke the power of Gallia in
an eight years' war has written the history of the
war himself. He was a soldier in his youth, like
most Romans of rank, and he had been a governor
in Spain shortly before he was consul. But it was
not till after he was more than forty years of age that
his military career commenced, and he obtained a
field wide enough for his daring and capacious
genius ......... The rapidity of Caesar's move-
ments, the immense extent of country over which
his military operations extended,-—his battles, his
sieges‚ his defeats‚ and his victories, with their
political consequences, give to his work an untir-
ing interest, if we read it with proper knowledge
and in a proper way; nor let any man, who thinks
that he knows something of modern warfare, ven-
ture to disparage either the Roman or his enemies=
