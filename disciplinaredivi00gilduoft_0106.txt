abundant leisure which, in the case of an officer
without intellectual resources, is sure to hang
heavily on his hands, if it be not the source of

of late brought scandal upon the army. This
wider advantage, we believe, will be found to con-

Cambridge (especially the former), as opposed to
any specific preparation. This preference, we
believe, was based on the acknowledged fact, that
the man who has passed through the higher uni-
versity course satisfactorily, although he may be
deficient in what is termed ‘⁶ useful knowledge,'’
will be more than a match for those whose same
three years have been spent in office romine, who
have, in fact, been merged in a system, before
they had acquired intellectual power and method,
sufficient to enable them to buoy themselves above
the engulfing waters of official life.*
