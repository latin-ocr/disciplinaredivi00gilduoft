There is, in the very exactness and unerring
nature of demonstrative proof, a tendency to tech-
nical precision‚ which, whilst it is invaluable as cm
exact mental discipline, is liable to abuse as the sole
discipline of so free and complex an entity as the
'human mind. The impossibility of following the
course of those lengthened processes, which depend
for their success upon the use of arbitrary formulae,
at the same time that it renders the mind such
relief and aid as it could not dispense with in
these abstract investigations‚ is not productive of

tion of the word classical, and also that we do not consider
that mathematics afford the ground of a perfect logical
training, we may quote the following passage from an
authority as great in one department of mental culture as
the other :—“ A mind well disciplined in elementary
geometry and in general jurisprudence would be as well
prepared as mere discipline can make a mind, for most
trains of human speculation and reasoning. The mathe-
matical portion of such an education would give clear habits
of logical deduction, and a perception of the delight of de-
monstration3 while the moral portion of the education, as
we may call jurisprudence, would guard the mind from the
defect, sometimes ascribed to mere mathematicians‚ of see·
ing none but mathematica] proofs, and apply ing to all cases
mathematica] processes. A young man well imbued with
these, the leading elements of Athenian and Roman culture,
would, we need not fear to say, be superior in intellectual
discipline to three-fourths of the young men of our own
day, on whom all the ordinary appliances of what is called
a good education have been bestowed. Geometer and jurist,
the pupil formed by this culture of the Old World might
make no bad figure among the men of letters or of science,
the lawyers and the polifficians, of our own times.''—Dr.
Whewell on Intellectual Education, 1854.
