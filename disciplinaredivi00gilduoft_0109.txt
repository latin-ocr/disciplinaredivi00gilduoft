the 331113 activity and unflagging attention as those
exercises in which 3 sustained action of the judg-
ment and the reflecting powers is indispensable to
success, By the term classics, we must be under-
stood to mean in this place 311 11131 13 ordinarily
comprehended under the notion of a classical as
distinct from a purely mathematical discipline ;
and our remarks upon the latter apply to its yeneral
applic⁸ation and value as an educational oryan, not
to its unlimited capability in the hands of men of

extraordinary power.
The tendency of the world now-a-days is to run
itself out of breath ;* to consider all time not spent

We have quoted the above passage in vindication of otu·
general design in these papers‚ and as guarding against
the misapprehension of a disproportionate regard for 0133-
sical studies, arising out of 0111 remarks in the present
paper. In 30 far as 0111 31111 111 11113 place is to speak of
Greek and Latin, we are teachers3 in so far as ‚ throughout
our several papers, respect is had to the harmonious com-
bination of all branches of study, we are educatorS. (See
Appendix to Inaugural Lecture on Modern History by
Dr. Arnold, pp. 37, 38. 1841.) With this caution, we
need only remark that we also recognise the necessity for
“ the exact and solid study of some portion of inductive
knowledge‚” as a discipline whereby “ 1113 mind may
escape from the thraldom and illusion which reigns in the
world of mere words.”

³⁸* True, what we are here indicating is only as the froth
upon the surface of deep waters3 but the ebullitions from
those depths of thought and action hinder the undisciplined
eye from discerning what is beneath. Hence the incon·
siderate harking away after the 110133 and the buffeting,
which, whilst it increases the confusion, adds in nowise to
theksum of work done or problems solved.
