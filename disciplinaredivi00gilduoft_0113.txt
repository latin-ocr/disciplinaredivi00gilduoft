into the most convenient order for use, all those
excellent materials for sacred study, which the
one great body of writings kindred to the N ew
Testament so richly supplies.''*—Clzristz'an Re-
membrancer, April, 1848, p. 295.

Α3 an introduction to one line of interesting
investigation‚ grounded in classical learning and
considered as a means of sustaining its life, viz„
the analysis of Latin poets with reference to Greek,
or of English with reference to both Greek and
Latin sources of imitation, we will again quote the
inaugural lecture of the Professor of Latin at Ox—
ford. His remarks upon the disciplinal value of
‘⁶ imitative literature,” and upon imitation as a
principle involved in the intellectual development

* “ The Septuagint version, taking the place it does to·
wards the New Testament scriptures, furnishes the remedy
for a certain infelicity attaching to that study of classica]
authors which in itself we so justly value as an instrument
of education. The infelicity is this,—that we sit down to
the study of the New Testament in Greek fresh from the
style and language of poets, philosophers, and historiam,
and with an idea of Greek derived from them exclusively.
Almost every word we meet with, unless indeed it chance
to be entirely new to us, comes clothed, in our idea, in the
dress of some classical association, of which we find some
difficulty in divesting it. But the Septuagint presents
Greek to us under another association, and the very one
under which we are glad to meet it. Greek has trod the
soil, and breathed the air, and caught the costume and the
tone of ‘ the glorious land-² Its words and phrases have
made new associations for themselves, and are recognised
denizens of this adopted country. '’-Christian Remembran cer,
April, 1848.
