of mankind, are most valuable. He says: “ In
speaking of Roman literature as imitative, it must
not be forgotten that the reproach is not peculiar
to it, but attaches to the whole of the literature of
modern Europe. Greece, in its independent ili-7
stinctive development, set the example which sub-
sequent nations have followed with more or less
of distinct consciousness. Even if we choose
to consider this conscious effort after an external
standard as fatal alike to national and individual
genius, we must admit it to be an inevitable evil,
inx‘rolved in the very position of those who have a
preceding civilization to reflect upon. Rome may
seem to have been more of a copyist than any of
its successors, partly as being actually more indebt-
ed to Greece, partly from the lateness of its intel-
lectual growth, which suggests the notion of rational
deliberation rather than of creative energy; but
the difference must not be exaggerated in either
case. If modern nations have followed Greece
less closely than Rome did, it is attributable to
the fact, among other causes, that they have had
Rome as well as Greece to follow. Nor will the
long barrenness of the Roman intellect prejudice
the judgment of those who bear in mind that the
Punic wars were in the life of the Eternal City
only what the war with Persia was in the briefer
history of Athens, and that even now, the true
literature of modern Germany, though one of the
richest that Europe can boast, is scarcely more
than a century old.''—-P. 10.
