Dr. Major has edited Milton's “ Paradise Lost,’'
with, illustrations from classical authors. Mr.
Boyes, of St. J ohn’s College, Oxford, has pub·
lished a volume of illustrations of AEschylus and
Sophocles. We refer to these two books as ex-

gesting. This labour, to be of the nature of a
mental discipline, must be the student’s own work.
We have found Tennyson's poems very rich in
classical allusions. Of the older poets, Gray fur-
nishes the most varied ground for illustration of
this kind. In M r. Pi‘ckering's Aldine edition this
has been done.

We fancy that few only of even the more ad-
vanced scholars at our schools achieve more than
a very limited acquaintance with any one author’s
writings as a whole. They become elegant scholars,
but it is hardly to be expected that they should be
very much more. They acquire the rudiments of
method, but they have scarcely realized the satis·
faction of applying that method to the many points
which go to make up a perfect understanding, e. 9.,
of one of the greater Roman poets. To one re-
turning voluntarily to the study of Horace or J uve—
nal, there will be an accession of taste and of power,
arising out of the very fact of the labour being self-
chosen, which will carry him into depths of meaning
and allusion unfathomed before. Schoolboys, as
such, are slow at appreciating the existence of
sound common sense in their author. They cannot
see in Horace and Cicero, the Pope and Dryden,
