Clio is stern and majestic. She has no flute
like Euterpe: her grace as compared with the
delicate beauty of the Muse of Lyric poetry is
masculine in its character. She more resembles
Melpomene with the tragic mask and sword. “And
yet it is not in the grand tragedy, or rather the
epic fictions, of history, that we learn the true con—
dition of former ages—the real character of past
generations, or even the actual effects that were
produced on society or individuals at that time,
by the great events that are there so solemnly re-
corded. If we have not some remnants or some
infusion of the comedy of middle life, we neither
have any idea of the state and colour of the
· general existence, nor any just understanding of
the transactions about which we are readings*

When the subject before us is the history of a
great people—the growth of its constitution, its
wars, its characteristic national features, its vicis-
situdes in the scale of nations—-we must expect to
find the page disfigured by the presence of that
smaller type, by which we so much dislike to have
our easy progress hindered‚ but which should in
such a subject be the unfailing ground of confi-
dence between the reader and his author, as it is
the evidence of his severest and most thankless
toil—the close and constant inspection of docu-
ments of various degrees of significance, the veri-
fication of dates, the more or less extensive perusal
of the literature of the period under review.
