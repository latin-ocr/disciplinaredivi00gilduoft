In order to be qualified to read history with
discernment, and with such a “ suspension of the
judgment’' as may leave us unfettered as to our
ultimate convictions, we must have well considered,
“ why history should be read 3 how it should be
read ; by whom it should be written; how it should
be written.” On these points we advise the careful
perusal of the Essay on History, in vol. i. of “ Friends
in Council‚’' as an admirable preparation for the in-
telligent study of the subject. The authortells us
(p. 231) that the reader of history “ should have
something of the spirit of research which was need-
ful for the writer.'’ Such a quality, both for its own
sake, and as the instrument of just conclusions in
matters of kindred interest and responsibility‚ we -
would commend to careful consideration.

A study of history, which should be based on,a
common-sense regard to the nature of things,
would be invaluable as an intellectual discipline,
and as a means of acquiring that ‘⁶ experience of
things which will fit men for advice and action,
when their country shall have need of their assist-
ancel’* It should be undertaken “ as a science,’'
and studied with precision. One advantage, in-
deed, of this study is, that it teaches us calmness

use of History.'' ‘⁶ At the same time, however, that we
claim for history great powers of instruction, we must not
imagine that the examples which it furnishes will enable
its readers to anticipate the experience of life.''—Friends
in Council, vol. i. chap. 11.
