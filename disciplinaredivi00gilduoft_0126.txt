not be forgotten that there 316 peculiar dangers
incident to a superficial survey of the past. One
great safeguard against any unwholesome result
of historical study, is the practica] direction which
we would give it, especially in the hands of the
young.

Let a man feel that, so far as he is concerned,
the history of his country will be a history of his

good or ill purposes, of his truthful or untruthful
habit of mind, of his selfish or disinterested policy 3
and then a speculative temper will be held in
check by a sense of personal responsibility3 zeal
be balanced by a desire to render his country the
precise service for which his talents and education
have fitted him; ambition be tempered by self-
respect, that vital clement of 1131101131 greatness.
It is in this spirit that we would commend a system· ‘
atie study of history.

We now go on to furnish a body of practical
suggestions on the study of history, collected out
of a few standard authorities Instead of throw-
ing these into the form of a brief abstract, we have
judged it better to give the very words of the
writers quoted. The passages in question are such
as will repay frequent perusal. They have been
selected with the view of opening the reader's eyes
to the real nature of historical study-—its peculiar
appropriateness at the present time—its disciplinal
value—and its feasibility. Under this last head
we have given 311 outline of the 1116111οᾱ which Dr.
Arnold prescribes for the student of modern history.
