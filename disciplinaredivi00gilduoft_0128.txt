Discz’plz’nal Value of Ancient History.

We would distinguish carefully between a broad
review of history, derived from the perusal of books
written with this design (such, for example, as
Wilberforce’s ‘⁶ Five Empires'’), and that careful
mastery of the elements of national existence*
which we would alone entitle the thorouylz study of
history. This disciplinal study‚ deep, accurate,
and searching, can of course be applied only to
short periods. “ One period of history, manfully
mastered in this way, becomes a key by which
many others may be unlocked for us ; and it re-'
mains meanwhile an ever-present warning against
theories‚ and a standard by which we can at any
time discover, with respect to any other periods,
how far we really do or do not know anything
about them.'’

‘⁶ With ancient history this has been very easy
to accomplish. Our accounts of the old nations
are preserved to us in the masterpieces of the ablest
writers, who have ever given their genius to'the

lang-uage, without importance‚ sense, or meaning, except
when looked at from the inner side, with some clear un-
derstanding of the nature of the people who did the things
of which we speak.''-Fr0ude.· Oagford Essays, 1855, p. 73.
