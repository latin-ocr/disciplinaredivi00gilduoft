making of books, while time has draughted off
into nothingness such inferior works as might have
confused and disturbed their effect. Thucydides
and Aristotle together transport us into the Athens
of Pericles. We study the Greeks of that age,
not through the minds of men divided from them
by centuries, but through the minds of their own
contemporaries, who shared the same actions, felt
the same emotions, thought by the same rules and
in the same forms. As much as can be done by
books at all, towards the bringing up before us the
vanished lives of human beings, is done by these
two writers in their pictures of the age in which
they lived. So Horace and Cicero give us the
Rome of Caesar, and Juvenal and Tacitus the
Rome of Nero. There the thing itself lives be-
fore us, distinct, or as distinct as words can make
it ; the outward incidents minutely detailed, and
detailed in transparent language, through which
the inner life of these incidents is visible, so far as
the keen eye could see into them, of men who
themselves witnessed what they describe. With
these histories, therefore, there has been no diffi-
culty in the manner in which they should be studied.
Those periods are selected on which the light is
thrown the strongest 3 and the books in which the
account of them is to be found are brief in com-
pass, few in number, easily distinguished, and, best
of all, may be followed with all but implicit cre-
dence.''
