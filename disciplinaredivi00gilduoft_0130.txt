they throw light on the general study of history,
and furnish some hints as to the course to be pur-

“ Anything in the nature of a calm analysis of
that on which we have been accustomed to feel
much more than we think, cannot but be useful
to us ..... Now here Ι must dwell for a moment
on our peculiar advantages in this place, in being
made so familiar with the histories of Greece and
of Rome ; for in those histories is involved a great

society, only somewhat simplified, as befits an
earlier and introductory study 3 and our familiarity
with their details will be convenient on the present
occasion, because they will furnish us with many
illustrations familiar already to all my hearers.
Besides this, he who has studied Thucydides and
Tacitus, and has added to them, as many of us
have done, a familiar acquaintance with Aristotle,
Plato, and Cicero, has already heard the masters
of political wisdom, and will have derived from
them some general rules to assist in making his
way through the thicket of modern history.’'-
