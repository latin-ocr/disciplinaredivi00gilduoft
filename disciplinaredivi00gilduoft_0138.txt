all our future reading3 because we shall always
know how to explore below the surface, whenever
we wish to do so, and we shall be able to estimate
rightly those popular histories which after all must
be our ordinary sources of information, except
where we find it needful to carry on our researches
more deeply.” This is that disciplinal study of his-
tory of which we spoke above, and which we shall
not exemplify in relation to any particular period,
but only describe in the abstract. We repeat
then, how is the student, ‘⁶ who purposes to ap-
ply himself to modern history,” to proceed2 He
