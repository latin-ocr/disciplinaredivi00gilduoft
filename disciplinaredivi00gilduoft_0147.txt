Here then we may remind the reader, that a
reverence for dates is absolutely essential to the
scientific pursuit of history. Sir Harris N icholas’s
“ Chronology of History’' is an indispensable hand—
book. The remarks prefixed to this work are
most valuable.

“ If history should be studied as a science, that
mankind may learn from the past what to expect
in the future, it necessarily follows, that all the
facts which history records ought to be referred,
with mathematical precision, to their proper dates ;
for if one of them be misplaced, the inferences
drawn from it will be founded upon false premises.
Chronology and geography have been justly 'called
the ‘ eyes of history,' without the lights of which,
all is chaos and uncertainty ; but, perhaps, a better
simile would be, that dates are to history what
the latitude and longitude are to navigation—
fixing the exact position of the objects to which
they are applied.''—-Sir H. N icholas’s Prqface to
Chronology cf H istory.

The necessity of a hand-book of this kind can-
not be understood by any one who is not acquainted
with the peculiar difficulties of the subject. A
glauce at the preface will be sufficient to inspire
the student with respect for what is termed in

French, “ l' art de verz‘fier les date8.”
As an exercise (edueation we might almost say)
