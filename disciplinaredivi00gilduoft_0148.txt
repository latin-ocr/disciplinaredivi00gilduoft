on the one point of scrupulous accur-acy, and for
instruction as to the temper in which the investi-
gation of fact should be conducted, we will allude
to Dr. Maitland's works; and herein to a small
volume entitled “ Eight Essays.”

“ Let it be remembered ..... that whatsoever
God has allowed to exist, or to be done, is an eter-
nal fact—that it has become a part of everlasting
and immutable truth—that nothing subsequent
can alter it—that if we had the power to analyze
any one such fact, we should find it to be a tree
‘ whose seed is in itself‚’ the produce of the past,
and the cause of the future, joined to both, as well
as to the present, by a thousand ties, invisible,
perhaps, but true, effectual, and indissoluble. As
the result, there exists a state of things which is
historic truth—a great fabric, filling all space,
fashioned as time goes on from everlasting to ever-
lasting, growing up to infinity by ceaseless and
imperishable increase—in all its minute details,
as well as in the boundless majesty of the whole,—
the work of Him who is building it according to
His will, asking no counsel, needing no help, un-
known except as He reveals Himself‚ understood
only as He gives understanding.”—Essay on Matter
ofFact, pp. 126, 127. .

We particularly recommend, in the way of men-
tal discipline, the study of this volume, and espe-
cially of the last three essays, in which Dr. Mait-
land has given an example of the mode in which
points of history should be handled.
