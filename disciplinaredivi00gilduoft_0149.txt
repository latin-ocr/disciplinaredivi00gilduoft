No'rEs oN 111s'roRY. 129

Whilst directing attention to the point of accu-
racy, we must not omit to mention a subject on
which Dr. Maitland expresses a strong judgment3
viz. that of historio-al novels. He says, “ Listen to
a voice which has just issued from the midst of
our Rolls and Records—‘ H1s‘r01110A1„ NoVELs
ΑΒΕ MORTAL ENEMIES 'ro ms'ronY? '’ With
Sir Francis Palgrave's dictum, we need scarcely
say, Dr. Maitland agrees. Per contra, and as in-
dicating a legitimate use, as it seems to us, of this
kind of writing,* we refer the reader to an essay
of Sir Archibald Alison's on the subject.

Mr. Helps requires that the writer of history
should combine in himself qualities which are held
to belong to opposite natures 3 that he should, at
the same time, be ‘⁶ patient in research and vigor—
ous in imayination, energetic and calm, cautious
and enterprising.’' ‘⁶ Above all things,” he says,
‘⁶ the historian must get out of his own age into
the time of which he is writing. Imayz'nation is
as much needed for the historian as the poet. You
may combine bits of books with other bits of books,
and so make some new combinations, and this may
be done accurately 3 and in general much of the
subordinate preparation for history may be accom-

* “ Ι know not whether others have been struck with
this equally3 but, for myself, I have seemed to gain a far
more lively impression of what J ames the First was, ever
since Ι read those humorous scenes in the ‘ Fortunas of

Nige1‚’ which remind one so forcibly that he spoke a broad
Seoteh dialect.’'—Arnold's Lectures, p. 67.
