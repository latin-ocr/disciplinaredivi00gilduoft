as auxiliary to the understanding of history, but
we must be content to refer to Dr. Arnold’s third
lecture on modern history, in which a deep and
scientific view of the subject is broached.

So also we would have spoken of antiquarian
studies, as subsidiary to historical research-but
we can do no more than quote a short passage from
Bacon's ‘⁶ Advancement of Learning,” in which the
several kinds of antiquities are enumerated. His-
tories, he tells us, are of three kinds, answering to
pictures or images, unfinished, perfect and defaced

fragments of stories, passages of books that con-
cern not story, and the like, do recover somewhat
from the deluge of time.’'*
