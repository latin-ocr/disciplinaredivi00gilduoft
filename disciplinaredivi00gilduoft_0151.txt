means of a series of coins, far into the past—along
which the mind would leam to travel with accu-
mulating interest and intelligence and each step
of which would serve as the best of all remem-
brancers to the young student of history. A valued
neighbour, great in all these sources of illustration,
suggests that the best present, which could be
given to a youth, as a stimulus and an aid to study‚
would be a well selected series of coins—adding
that these may be procured, on an average, at a
shilling each. This surely is a fact not generally
known.

As an illustration of the way in which the vari-
ous studies and pursuits of an accomplished mind
may be brought to bear upon the past, in the case
of one who has assumed the discipline of high
mental culture as the habit of his life, we give at
length the following picture :—

“ A man sits surrounded with the books of all
ages: among these he has passed the best years of
his life. He has gone in and out among them:
through their very substance he has made a path
for himself, in the course of methodical study ; and
with these he has conversed, discursively, as acci-
dent might lead him. Now we may imagine these
his companions to be set out in chronological per-
spective on his tables and carpet, right and left,
each ascending to its date. Thus placed, they are
so many candles lit, shedding their beams over the
expansa of .. centuries, up to the remotest eras.
Many deep shadows still rest upon spots and spaces
