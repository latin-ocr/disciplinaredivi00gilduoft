face answereth to face in a glass,’ so do the visages
and the legends of medallions and of sculptures
answer to, interpret, and sustain the pages of the
historians, poets, philosophers, of the corresponding
times. Taken altogether, or considered in their
aggregate effect, these accumulated materials give
a familiarity and an assurance to the historic con—
sciousness which does not rate lower than does the
feeling as to any class of objects that are not ac-
tually present to the senses.’'*

To this “ ripened condition of the faculties,’'
this, “ state of plenary consciousness towards the
things, the persons, the events of past time” as
‘⁶ the fruit of high culture and of life-long habits’'
of discipline, we would invite the young student of
history. Our object, be it remembered, is, “ not to
dictate truths, but to stimulate exertion,''—in a
word, to quicken ‘⁶ the energy that is determined
in the quest and contemplation of truths.’' By
this quickeniny, more than by ‘⁶ the mere posses—
sion of truths,’' is the mind “ invigorated and de-
veloped,'' and the highest end of education secured.
