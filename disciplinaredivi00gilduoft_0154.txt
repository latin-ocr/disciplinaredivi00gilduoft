with our present enquiry only in so far as it is the
subject of mental discipline, or of what has been
aptly termed “ the ethics of study.” Hence, what
to some may seem the uninviting character of these
remarks upon a point of lively interest, and which
might seem to justify a less severe method of treat-
ment. We begin, then, not inappropriately, by a
warning against a superficial habit of mind.·

The very notion of general literature is proba—
bly in many minds associated with Mudie’s Library‚
book societies, and the necessarily rapid survey of
current literature incident to such a mode of cir-
culation. Again, the common practice of having
recourse to reviews, for the purpose of forming a
judgment upon works of all kinds (never other-
wise perused), is plainly productive of a habit of
slight general acquaintance with many books, as
opposed to the thorough knowledge of a few, and
must, accordingly, not be lost sight of in our esti-

recommend a habit of more thoughtful and sys— Ι

conflicting tendency in the world at large.
