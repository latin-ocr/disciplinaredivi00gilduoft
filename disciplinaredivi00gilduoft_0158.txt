come into existence only at a later period. Now
with a view to this object, anything short of an
almost complete perusal of the writer's words from
beginning to end is superficia13 because I cannot
be in a condition to decide the question on a par-
tial hearing of the evidence3 and the evidence in
this case is not any given portion of the author’s
writings‚ but the whole of them. Again, if I wish
to know what a writer has said on some one par-

display his historical powers sufficiently3 if he be a poet,
the strength and character of his genius will appear, with·
out our reading every line which he has written.”—Arnold’s
Lemures, pp. 76, 77.
