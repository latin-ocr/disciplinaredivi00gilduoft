GENERAL LITERATURE. 143

the still deeper waters of general philosophy*
There are very few, if any, vacant spaces between
various kinds of knowledge: any track in the
forest, steadfastly pursued, leads into one of the
great highways 3 just as you often find, in con-
sidering the story of any little island, that you are
perpetually brought back into the general history
of the world, and that this small rocky place has
partaken the fate of mighty thrones and distant
empires.† In short, all things are so connected
together, that a man who knows one subject well,

⁸ Witness Helps's “ Spanish Conquest in America‚'’
recently published. “ The course of history is like that
of a great river wandering through various countries3 now
in the infancy of its current, coHecting its wasers from
obscure small springs in plashy meadows, and from un·
considered rivulets, which the neighbouring rustics do not
know the names of 3 now in its boisterous youth, forcing
its way through mountains3 now in middle life, flowing
with equable current busily by great towns, its waters
sullied, yet enriched with commerce3 and now in its bur-
dened old age, making its slow and difficult way with an
ever-widening expanse of waters, over‘which the declining
sun looms grandly to the sea.''—(Vol. i. p. 274.) Seldom
has a more lavish pledge been given than is conveyed in
these few lines, and in Mr. Helps's earlier historical pre-
scriptions (Friends in Council, vol. i. pp. 230—24o)3 and
never has a pledge, so given, been more conscientiously
redeemed than in the accomplished author’s last great
work, here referred to.

† For example, the story of the Crimean peninsula.
“ The land is literally scarred with the foot-prints of by-
gone events. . . . All the great nations of historic times
have left on its sui-face traces of their power.''—Archdeacon
Grant.
