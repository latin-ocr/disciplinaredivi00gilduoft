purpose of illustration. On this account, we di—
rect attention to a short essay, in preference to
naming any of those larger treatises which profess
to give a detailed and exhaustive course of study.
Such books have their use, but we cannot admit
their disciplinal value.

For a general view of literature, and varied il-
lustrations of its ‘⁶ Pleasures, Objects‚ and Advan-
tages,'' we would recommend the perusal of a book
written under this title by Mr. Willmott. It is
well calculated to inspire a taste for literature*

We would also advise a very careful perusal of
the scholar-like “ Remarks on the Cultivation of
Taste in the Young, through the Medium of our
own Writers‚” contained in the preface to “ Eng-
’ lish Repetitions, in Prose and Verse,’' by J. F.
Boyes, M.A.†

As a means of turning to full account that fixed-
ness of pursuit and method in reading which we
have been recommending, we would advise the
practice of ‘⁶ committing to writing our acquired
knowledge.” Such a habit is chiefly valuable for
‘⁶ the foundation which it lays for a perpetual pro-
gress in the intellectual powers of the individual.
..... It is only by constant practice of writing,
that the results of our experience and the progress
of our ideas can be accurately recorded.''1 Writing,
