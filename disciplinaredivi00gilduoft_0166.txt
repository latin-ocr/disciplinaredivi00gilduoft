not from memory merely, but in connection with
the actual process of thought, and consequent upon
the digestion of what we read, is the main instru-
ment of accuracy to the student.

The student should always have in hand some
book, in the branch of literature marked out for
him, which he may master, by slow degreeS, as the
business of his studious hours. This book should
be one of ascertained disczplinal valae—a treatise
of some author distinguished for close reasoning
and vigorous thought.

The use of books of amusement is well set forth
and defined by Mr. Helps in the essay above re—
ferred to. It is a point which must be settled by
the student for himself, according to his own con—
science. Upon the right adjustment of this ques-
tion (at least once for all) will depend the ad-
vantage or the 1131111 to be derived from reading
of this character. It has a moral and intellectual
value, in proportion as it is advisedly undertaken,
whether as a relief and antidote to severer studies,
or for a definite purpose in relation to such litera-
ture. An unmeasured diet of “light and sarcastic
works ''—an antagonism (in place of an alternation)
between those of a deeper and those of 3 less serious
character—is enervating to the mind and subver-
sive of mental discipline.

In combating “ the habit of thoughtless and
purposeless reading” in the young, we conceive
that we contribute something towards general
intelligence and steadiness of aim, in relation to

‘⁴ the current questions of the day.”
