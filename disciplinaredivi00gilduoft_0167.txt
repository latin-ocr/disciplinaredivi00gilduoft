AND INDUCTIVE.

“ That scientific philosophy, which ultimately supplies
the principles of all other knowledge, can never be displaced
from its lawful position, without producing an ill-balanced,
imperfect system of education.'’—Oxford studies by Rev.
M. Pattison.

N DER this title we propose briefly to dis-
cuss the characteristic value of logic, the
mathematical, and the so-called inductive sciences,
as instruments of mental discipline. By defining
these sciences, in relation to their respective func-
tions‚ we may hope to arrive at a more compre-
hensive view of scientific method in general. Our
object will be rather to use precise and distinctive
language in our review of the subject, citing as
heretofore one or two high authorities for the state-
ments advanced, than to enter upon the province
of logie or mathematics‚ or to set-forth inducements
to a study of any one of the inductive sciences.
In the first place we must claim for logie (λογική)
a wider province and a more comprehensive basis
than is popularly accorded to it. Logic has been
defined as “ the science of the laws of thought.”
As such it underlies ‘⁶ the real sciences.'' Tbey
