science.* ‘⁶ Logic assists us in the study of the
sciences, not stands in their stead.’' “ When men
think, the rules of logic are the rules according to
which their thoughts run. . . .” “ It gives us the
forms of knowledge, not the matter.” “ It is a
searching and systematic account of processes,
which men daily perform whether in thought or in
argument, in the pur-suit of a science, or in the
transactions of the market.''†

The true functions of logic have been on the one
hand so overlaid and exaggerated, on the other so
understated and misjudged, that, between intem-

perate advocacy and indiscriminating hostility, its

ἕ “ Logic, by a famous distinction is dividedz—into
theoretical or general logic (χωρὶς πραγμάτων, docens), in
so far as it analyzes the mere laws of thought3 and into
practica] or special logic (ἐν χρήσει, utens), in so far as it
applies these laws to a certain matter or class of objeets.
The former is one, and stands in the same common relation
to all the sciences3 the latter is mamfold, and stands in
proximate relation to this or that particular science, with
which it is in fact identified. Now, as all matter is either
necessary or contingent (a distinction which may be here
roughly assumed to coincide with mathematica! and non-
mathematical), we have thus, besides one theoretica] or
general logio, also two practical or special logics in their
highest universality and contrast.
