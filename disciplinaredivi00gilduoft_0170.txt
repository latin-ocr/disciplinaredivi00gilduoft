junction with sciences of humbler style and pre-
tensions can it further the interests of philosophy
or add to the stock of knowledge 3²³* but it is also
true, that mathematical science has no language
but what logic prescribes, for an introduction to
or a discussion of its operations and a free hand-

meter,'' says Aristotle, “ can attempt no discussion
of his principles.'' “ It is wholly beyond the
domain of mathematics, to inquire into the origin
and nature of their principles.'’†

The subject matter of mathematics is concemed
only, or at any rate mainly, with the conditions of

is this the business of logic, as such, but logic is the in-

conducted.

relation of quantities—equality and inequality3 the phi·
losophical sciences, on the contrary, are astricted to none
of the categories, are co-extensive with existence and its
modes, and circumscribed only by the capacity of the
human intellect itself.''—Sir W. Hamilcon, Discussions, ἀμ,
