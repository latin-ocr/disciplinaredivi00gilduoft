Mathematical reasoning pays the tribute of
unfailing allegiance to the science of the laws of
thought ; in other words, the correctness of mathe-
matical reasoning consists in a due observance of
the prescriptions of the logical method. But

simile), or true event3 like it in itself, in its evidence, in
some more or fewer of its circumstances-''—Introduction to
Bp. Butler's Analogy.

ἢ Same as the “ Practical Logic (2) of Sir W. Hamilton’s
scheme, given above3 i. e. ‘ practical logic as specially ap-
plied to contingent matter.' ''

“ Applied Logic teaches the application of the forms of
thinking to those objects about which men do think. These
objects arrange themselves under three great divisions—
Man, the Universe, and Absolute Being. When the views
we take of objects are substantially correct, when our
thoughts correspond with facts, we are said to be in pos-
session of the truth. . . . It is the scienoe of the necessary
laws of thought as employed in attaining truth.''—Outline

“ In pure logie, the different processes of the mind are
regarded in their perfect and complete state3 whilst in
applied, the imperfect faculties of man, the limited oppor-
tunities of observation, the necessity of deciding upon a
question when the materials of a judgment are still insuffi-
cient, impose many limitations on the perfection of our
knowledge. Thus, whilst pure logie only treats of argu-
ments that are certain and irrefutable, the most important
duty of applied logie is to determine under what conditions
imperfect arguments, such as the example, the imperfect
induction, the deduction from a proposition that is not
