beyond the province of necessary truth. Mathe-
matical training, therefore, as distinguished from
the incalculable ‘⁶ value of mathematical science
considered in itself or in its objective results,’' is
one-sided as a mental discipline, and involves “ the
disproportionate development of one power at the
expense of others.'’

“ It is an ancient and universal observation,
that different studies cultivate the mind to a dif-
ferent development; and as the end of a liberal
education is the general and harmonious evolution
of its faculties and capacities in their relative sub-
ordination,* the folly has accordingly been long
and generally denounced, which would attempt to
accomplish this result by the partial application of
certain partial studies.'’†

Further as regards the question of relative dis-
ciplinal value, ‘⁴ mathematical language‚ precise
and adequate, nay, absolutely convertible with
mathematical thought, can afford us no example of
those fallacies which so easily arise from the am-

truly universal. . . . can be fairly employed, and to show
that though these weaker forms are so many deviations
from a perfect demonstrative argument, they are so far
from superseding the perfect forms, that in reality each of
them appeals to and attests the cogency of some perfect

· form, to which it strives, as it were, to conform itself.''—
