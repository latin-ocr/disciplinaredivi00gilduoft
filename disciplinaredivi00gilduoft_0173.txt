therefore, it is evident, supply us with any means of
obviating those illusions from which it is itself
exempt.'’—Ibz'd. p. 284.

Again, “ Mathematics afford us no assistance
either in conquering the difficulties or in avoiding
the dangers which we encounter in the great field
of probabilities wherein we live and move.’'—Ibid.
p. 284.

Again, ‘⁶ Mathematical demonstration is solely
occupied in deducing conclusions ; probable rea-
soning principally concerned in lookz'ny out for pre-
mises. All mathematica] reasoning flows from,
and, admitting no tributary streams, can be traced
back to, its original source: principle and conclu-
sion are convertible. The most eccentric deduc-
tion of the science is only ‚the last ring in a long
chain of reasoning, which descends, with adaman-
tine necessity, link by link, in one simple series,
from its original dependence. In contingent mat-
ter, on the contrary, the reasoning is comparatively
short 3 and as the conclusion can seldom be securely
established on a single antecedent, it is necessary,
in order to realize the adequate amount of evidence,
to accumulate probabilities by multiplying the
media of inference, and thus to make the same con-
clusion, as it were, the apex of many convergent
arguments. (Compare Aristot. Analyt. Post. 1. 12,
ς 13.) In general reasoning, therefore, the capa-
cities mainly requisite, and mainly cultivated, are
the prompt acuteness which discovers what ma-
