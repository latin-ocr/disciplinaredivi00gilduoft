terials are wanted for our premises, and the activity,
knowledge, sagacity, and research able compe-
tently to supply them. In demonstration, on the
contrary, the one capacity cultivated is that patient
habit of suspending all intrusive thought, and of
continuing an attention to the unvaried evolution
of that perspicuous evidence which it passively
recognizes, but does not actually discover. Of
Observation, Experience, Induction, Analogy, the
mathematician knows nothing.”—Ibia¹. pp. 284,
285.

One great impediment to the adoption of logie
as a mental discipline, is the erroneous impression
that induction has no place in the science. Now
the truth is, that the scientific clement in induc—
tionis supplied by logie. In conducting this pro-
cess the observer is dependent for guidance upon
those rules which the science of the laws of thought
supplies.

“ It is a great misfortune for logie, that the
syllogism has been regarded as an instrument for
deduction only ...... The syllogism is not con-
fined to deductive arguments. Every one of the
inductive methods already described* falls easily

treated of in Mr. Thomson's book on Logic. We subjoin

Mr. E. Forbes says, “ he was a forward-looking philoso-

it, yet different from it, would be washed up by the waves
