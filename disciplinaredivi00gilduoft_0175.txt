into an appropriate syllogistic form3 and we can
no more reason without making syllogisms than
we can speak and argue without forming sentences.
What grammar does for speech, logie does for
thought 3 it ascertains its simple elements and ex-
hibits them, and if it be found that the inductive
processes do not fall readily under the old forms,
it would be right to consider first whether the
forms could be amended and enlarged, rather than
to abandon at once one half the territory of thought,
the whole of which logie has always by its names
and definitions seemed to claim.’'

But what are our readers to understand by these
terms induction and deductim ,9 Some notion doubt-
less they must have acquired even from their pre-
ι sent application to sciences, with whose general
character they are acquainted ; but we will give a
more precise account of them before proceeding to
remark upon the so-called inductive sciences.

These two terms then divide between them all
that wide domain which is included within the
limits of the reasoning processes. Together they
constitute scientific method—that method which
has been man’s great instrument in the discovery
and adjustment of truth‚ whether consciously or
unconsciously, since his creation. “ Induction is

next tide.''—-(Glaucus.) This is something ‘ff what z's meant
by Anticipation. In full it is ‘⁶ the power whereby the
mind presages a truth before it is fairly proved, before she
makes the attempt to establish it by exact and cautious
modes.”
