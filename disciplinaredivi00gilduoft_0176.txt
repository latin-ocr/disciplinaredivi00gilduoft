’ usually defined to be the process of drawing a
general law* from a sufficient number of particular
cases; deduction is the converse process, of prov-
ing that some property belongs to a particular case,
from the consideration that it comes under a gene-
ral law. More concisely‚ induction is the process

³* “ A law or rule is a general principle embodying a
class of facts3 when it is regarded in its connection with
theory it usually has the former name, and when it is con·
cerned with practice, the latter. The formation of such
general propositions is the first procedure in the formation
of science3 at the same time they are of little service, un·
less accompanied by the ascertainment of causes.”—0ut-
line, ἐξα, p. 288.

“ We call the law of gravitation an inductive laW, and
speak of deductions from it. . . . But we analyze a fact or
a substance and make a synthesis (or placing together of
elements) to reproduce the fact or substance.'' . . . . “ The
supposed general principle may be tried by applying it to
a new particular case3 the analysis of a fact into its ele·
ments may be tested by putting the elements together anew,
and seeing if the fact is reproduced ..... If on applying
some general principle, of which we are still uncertain, to
a new particular case, we find that it helps to explain the
particular, this is one fruit of the process3 and another is,
that our confidence in the general principle is materially
strengthened. Law explains fact 3 fact confirms law, And
after this alternate ascent and descent has been a few times
performed, our belief in the correctness of its results is
quite complete.''—Outline, &a ξ 119 : Complete and Incom-
plete Induction.

“ The correctness of synthesis is proportionate to that
of the preceding analysis3 and a doubtful analysis may be
confirmed by a synthesis. In other words, a correct in·
duction furnishes the premises for a sound deduction, and

a doubtful induction must be verified by deductions from
it.”-Ibid.
