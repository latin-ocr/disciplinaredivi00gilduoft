of discovering laws from facts, and causes from
effects: and deductim, that of discovering facts
from laWS, and effects from their causes.”

The first steps in a science which has to do with
contingent truths must necessarily be inductive.
Until certain general laws have been ascertained,
it can assume no other form. But long before it
can claim the character of a perfect or quasi-per-
fect science, it must have recourse to deductive
processes.* This form of deducfion, however, is
lost sight of in the necessity for a continuous sys-
tem of induction, and thus many sciences which
deal largely in deductive method are yet called,
par excellence, inductive. All sciences (save pure
mathematics) must throughout be, to a certain ex-
tent, both inductive and deductive3 but until a
certain point has been arrived at, the former char-
acter predominates.

In some of the sciences this period of imperfec—
tion is of long continuance. The maintenance of
an unwearied and laborious empiricism does not
yield an adequate return in the field of deductive
science, The result of varied experiments and
investigation is not of so exact or comprehensive
a nature as to form the groundwork for the adop-
tion of any regular system of rigid demonstra-
tion. This is peculiarly the case with Chemistry‚
