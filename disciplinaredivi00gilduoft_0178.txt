in which, more than in any other science, the
analytical method prevails.

On the other hand Astronomy has attained the
dignity of a deductive or perfect science. This
development may be traced to the “ physico-ma-
thematical'' character of the conditions with which
it has to do. It is the best illustration that can
be given of the connection between induction and
deduction, as phases of scientific method.*

An inductive science culminates‚ so to speak‚
in deduction. Having attained the ripeness of
its being through the slow stages of an experi-
mentalism in which induction is gradually dis-
placed by a partial and relative deduction, it puts
forth triumphant strength through the right arm
of deductive method. Its career henceforward is
no longer the painful climbing of baffling heights‚
but a clear-sighted diving into the mysteries and
deeper truths of Nature. The certainty of its
predictions invests it with an awfulness‚ which, even
to the intelligent mind, is little short of over-
whelming.

Armed with these two instruments of progressive
intelligence, man may indeed aspire to the dignity

* ‘⁶ By the mutual co-operation of these two processes
the physical sciences are advanced. . . . The certainties by
which the chemist‚ the astronomer, and the geologist con-
ducts his operations with composure and success, were once
bare possibilities, which, after being handed back and for·
ward between induet-ion and deduction, turned out to be
truths.”-0utline‚ 850„ p. 313.
