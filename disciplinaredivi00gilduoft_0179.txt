of the ‘⁶ naturae minister et interpres.'' He may
well be content to grope his way, stooping, through
any one of the labyrinths of empirica] discipline,*
if he but find himself at the last beneath the illi-
mitable canopy,—the blue expanso of a new world
of scientific contemplation.

Into this new world the steps of a difficult and
painful progress have admitted the astronomer of
this favoured age. The last few years have wit-
nessed a triumph of which no earlier stage in the
development of the science could have admitted,
It was not on the instance of any phenomena ap-
preciable by the eye of empiricism, but on the con-
templation of certain disturbances in a clearly-
defined system of planetary revolution, that a
simultaneous prediction was confidently hazarded
by two persons, standing on the extreme ascertained
limits of the science. The discovery of the planet
Neptune is the seal of the completed cycle of
scientific method. By the* deductive character,
mode, and peculiar conditions of this discovery,
astronomy has established its previously advanced
claim to the dignity of an exact science.

The astronomer has now outrisen the machinery
of an incomplete experimentalism. He has won
for himself a means of advance independent of
those aids which the previous imperfection of the
science rendered necessary. His lenses are the
instruments of the inductive stage of the science;
