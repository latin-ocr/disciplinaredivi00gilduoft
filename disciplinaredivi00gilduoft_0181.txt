of some one of these sciences is invaluable as a
training in the practice of generalization, as well
as for the quickening of the powers of observation.

We speak here only of those sciences which, to
the majority of men, are of the nature of a by-
pursuit (πάρεργον), to the exclusion of those which
claim a wider attention, and a more serious adop-
tion ; as the practical sciences of social life, and
whose subject matter is the field of man’s necessi-
ties. Such are the “ physico-medical'' and “ me·—
dical science proper'‘ and the ‘⁴ political sciences.”
Each of these is of course a necessary instrument
of mental discipline to its professor, and probably
to many a medium of logical training, which they
do not recognize. It would be interesting to con-
sider, by the way, whether an inkling of this un-
appreciated fact might not lead some of the younger
of our professional men to a definite study of that
unconscious logical method to which they are so
much indebted. ‘⁶ True,” after the most exact
study of method, “ we must still fight our own
way over every inch of ground in the field3 but
logic will often prevent our throwing away our
blows.'' Such a ‘⁶ searching and systematic’' re-

chology, botany, and comparative anatomy, with a. care
and a reverence, a caution and a severe induction, which
had been never before applied to them 3 and thus, gradually,
in the last half century, the whole choir of cosmical sciences
have acquired a soundness, severity, and fulness, which
render them, as mere intellectual exercises, as valuable to
a manly mind as mathematics and metaphysics.''——Glaucus‚
