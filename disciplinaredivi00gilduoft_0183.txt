each fact* and discovery, not as our own possession,
but as the possession of its Creator, independent
of us, our tastes, our needs, or our vainglory,—
we hardly need to speak : for it is the very essence
of the naturalist's faculty,—the very tenure of his
existence ; and without truthfulness, scienee would
be as impossible now as chivalry would have been
of old. Happy, truly, is the naturalist. He has
no time for melancholy dreams. The earth be-
comes to him transparent ; everywhere he sees sig-
nificances, harmonies, laws, chains of cause and
effect endlessly interlinked, which draw him out
of the narrow sphere of sels-interest and sels-pleas-
ing into a pure and wholesome region of solemn
joy and wonder.”

We must here conclude our remarks on Science.
To discuss the characteristic features of the in-
ductive and deductive philosophy throughout,
would be beside our present purpose. We are
content with having endeavoured to disclose a
more comprehensive view of scienee, than the youth
of seventeen is commonly by himself enabled to
take. To have attempted to define 3 course of
scientific study, or to speak with greater distinct-
ness of any one of the sciences, would have been
to sacrifice our design of furnishing a review of
scientific method in general. Any one being in
earnest about the adoption of 3 particular branch
of study, will find abundant store of special assist-
ance ready to his hand.
