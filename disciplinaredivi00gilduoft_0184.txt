SOME REMARKS UPON MORAL PHILOSOPHY.

Τὸ τέλος ἐστὶν ὀυ γνῶσις ἀλλὰ πρᾶξις.

HIS branch of mental science* calls for spe-

cial consideration. It is that great philo-

sophy whose subject matter is the vast ‘⁶ field of
probability in which we live and move.” It is
peculial-ly the science of human life and human
necessity. As such, its study is calculated to dis-
cipline the largest region of human intelligence‚
and that under the light and steady influence of
the largest human responsibility. As men, our
minds are less naturally directed to the contem-
plation of what are called scientific truths‚ than to
the observation and analysis of those phenomena
