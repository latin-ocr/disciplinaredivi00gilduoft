of human conduct which accompany us and be—
speak our presence in the natural worldfl* As
men, we cannot fail to receive the impressions of
the true philosopher of morals. He finds the
principles of his philosophy in the hearts of all,
and can speak 'to us in a language which is at once
scientific and familiar. When engaged in the
study of moral philosophy, we exert the power of
sels-consciousness in a manner quite distinct from
religious sels-contemplation. This attitude of the
mind, generalizing upon the symptoms and the
facts of its own being, is the¹ philosophical atti-
tude.

The province of Moral Philosophy is not under
the exclusive jurisdiction of any one class of en—
quirers. It is common ground, so to speak, where
all have right of pasturage, and to which all may
find ready access from the field of their own re-
stricted enquiries. It is the philosophy of natural
and revealed religion alike. It has two aspects or
characters: the one theoretical, wherein it is re-
garded as a science, dealing with principles alone
—the science of morals3 the other practical, in
which it may, in some sense, be considered to be
an arg—the ethical art, or the law-3 of moral science

reduced to a system of ναίω and practical prescrip-
tions.†

very fact that this line of the poet. is a. “ hackneyed '' quota-
tion, is surely, in itself, significant.
