166 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

“ Moral philosophy‚” says an able writer, “ must
not be confounded with ethics, properly so called,
or with casuistry ; its province is of a higher order,
its subject matter more comprehensive3 it is not
merely to furnish admonitions and exhortations to
duty, nor to solve difficult questions of rare occur-
rence; if it be entitled to the name of philosophy,
and to take its place among the sciences, it must
search after principles ; it must ascend to the source
of duty and obligation; it must examine the na-
ture of man, and analyze his mental faculties; and
must lay the foundations of morals in the pheno-
>mena of mind. In a word, its business is to teach
men their obligations, and the reasons and prin-
ciples of them. As these obligations branch out
into the duties of citizens no less than individuals,
it comprehends political science along with ethics,
properly so called; as they have their origin and
root in the feelings and affections of our intellec-
tual nature, it is closely and inseparably connected
with mental philosophy. Moral philosophy, then
in its widest sense comprehends all those subjects
which are most interesting and important to the
welfare of individuals and communities.”*

The task of the moral philosopher is connected
with most weighty and comprehensive considera-
tions. The field of his scientific labours has been

in our last chapter, for the differenee between laws and
rules.
