directly advantageous to the growth of a sound
philosophy in the minds of those who have to
direct or influence its operations. It may indeed
be hurtful to them, if they are not in the habit of
recollecting themselves in the midst of manifold
technicalities‚ and reverting alike to the first prin-
ciples of right and to the condition of humanity in
relation to the operation of those principles. On
the other hand, may we not conceive it to be
beneficial to the young lawyer to seek in moral
science a relaxation from the restraints of artificial
obligations, and an unbending of that constrained
attitude of mind which the study of human law,
as such, necessitates? In moral philosophy he
rises, so to speak, into that higher atmosphere, in
which considerations other than human are al-
lowed to mingle with and temper justice. He
has, at such times, an ear for the* complaints and
for the bitter remonstrances of human frailty (ay,
and of a more subtle equity)‚ of which he must,
in his inn of court, be heedless. He has an eye
for other circumstances, in the cases submitted to
him, than those which can be comprehended in
the severe formularies of judicial defence and im·-
peachment.

By such studies, and by an induction from the
facts and phenomena of human action that meet

justice, as not to discredit the solid foundations of laW, as
laid deep in the principle of right, and witnessed and ap-
proved by “ the general voice of mankind.”
