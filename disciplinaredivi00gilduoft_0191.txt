lightenment, there is much room for many workers3
men of that quiet wisdom and character which is
the growth of discipline3 men of that large saith,
which can commit the issue of its labours to other
means than those under its own sole control, and
which is not what the world calls liberality ,· men
who have a definite belief and a definite religious
purpose, which bimis them, but teaches them anon
that patience, which should be, in a world like
this, the smoothest-worn side of many-sided charity.

But to proceed with our subject. “ Difficulties
may press around us at every step in the investi-
gation of such subjects as moral philosophy pre-
sents 3 we may be continually baffled in our ex-
pectation, but the truth, though partiaHy, will not
be entirely concealed 3 and the imperfect know-
ledge we gain will amply reward the labour em-
ployed3 and, like the alchymists in their search
after gold, even if we fail of success, we shall meet
with many valuable discoveries by the way, to be
employed for the benefit of ourselves and others,
Enquiries of this kind, if properly conducted, im-
part strength, acuteness, and elevation to the un-
derstanding, beyond any other studies whatever3
and the man who has been trained at an early
period of life in this course of mental cultivation,
will be sensible of its advantageous effects in every
branch of investigation, whether practica] or spe-
culative, to which he may subsequently devote
himself. The graces of poetry and eloquence may
be necessary to adorn the temple of knowledge,
