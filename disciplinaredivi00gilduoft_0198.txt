around which the student might gather very varied
illustration, and the fruits of other ethical studies.

Dr. Whewell has detached the sermons and
treatises just named from the rest of Bishop But-
ler’s writings‚ and prefixed a valuable analysis and
preface of his own‚—publishing the whole in a
small volume* To any one desimus of laying a
sound foundation in moral science, we would re-
commend the very careful study of this combina-
tion of treatises—-the study, in short, which Bishop
Butler himself demands as absolutely necessary to
the understanding of a subject abstruse in itself,
and involving much of abstract thought and argu-
ment. The prescriptions alluded to are contained
in the preface to his sermons, and will be recog-
nized by our readers as having been in part adopted
in a former chapter. In fact, they set forth the
essential conditions of all study whatsoever, and
are worthy of constant perusal‚ apart from the im—
mediate connection in which they stand.
