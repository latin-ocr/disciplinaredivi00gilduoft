to have larger hearts and larger political sympathies
than were in fashion in the days of Elizabeth ‘⁶ of

alluring young children by gentleness to love learning, and
of the special care that was to be had to keep young men
from licentious living, he was most earnest with me to
have me say my mind also, what Ι thought concerning the
fancy that many young gentlemen of England have to
travel abroad, and namely, to live a long life in Italy.
His request, both for his authority and good will toward
me, was a sufficient commandment unto me, to satisfy his
pleasure with uttering plainly my opinion in that matter.
‘ Sir,' quoth I, ‘ I take going thither, and living there, for
a young gentleman that doth not go under the keep and
guard of such a man, as both by wisdom can, and authority
dare rule him, to be marvellous dangerous.' ..... ‘ Yet
if a gentleman needs travel in Italy, he shall do well to
look to the life of the wisest traveller that ever travelled
thither, set out by the wisest writer that ever spake with
tongue‚ God's doctrine only excepted3 and that is Ulysses
in Homer. . . . Yea, even those that be learned and witty
travellers, when they be disposed to praise travelling, as
a great commendation, and the best Scripture they have
for it, they gladly recite the third verse of Homer, in his
first book of Odyssea, containing a great praise of Ulysses,
for the wit he gathered and wisdom he used in travelh‘ng :—
. ‘ Πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα, καὶ νόον ἔγνω.’

And yet is not Ulysses commended so much, nor so oft in
Homer, because he was πολύτροπος; this is, skilful in
many men's manners and fashions3 as because he was
πολύμητις-5 that is, wise in all purposes and wary in all
places. Which wisdom and wariness will not serve never
a traveller, except Pallas be always at his elbow, that is,
God’s special grace from Heaven to keep him in God’s
fear in all his doings, in all his journey. ’'—Ascham’s Schote-
master, pp. 73—77.
