glorious memory.’' We certainly have duties and
interests, as a nation, which have not hitherto been

generally recognized. Perhaps these responsibili-
ties never before existed in the full force in which

hear say, they meddle as little with the one as with the
other. A marvellous case, that gentlemen should be so
ashamed of good learning, and never a whit ashamed of ill
manners! Such do say for them, that the gentlemen of
France do so 3 which is a lie, as God will have it. Langaeus
and Bellaeus, that be dead, and the noble Vidam of Chartres‚
that is alive, and infinite more in France which Ι hear tell
of, prove this to be most false. And though some in F rauce,
which will needs be gentlemen, whether men will or
no, and have more gentleship in their hat than in their
head, be at deadly feud with both learning and honesty‚
yet I believe, if that noble prince, King Francis the First,
were alive, they should have neither place in his Court nor
pension in his wars if he had knowledge of them. This
opinion is not French, but plain Turkish, from whence some
French feteh more faults than this3 which I pray God
keep out of England.''—Ibid.‚ pp. 57, 58.

Roger Ascham complains bitterly of the licentiousness
of the “ Englishmen Italianated'' of his own day, and of
the many “ fond books of late translated out of Italian into
English, sold in every shop in London3 commended by
honest titles, the sooner to corrupt honest manners.''—-

. . . “ Not because I do contemn either the knowledge
of strange and divers tongues, and namely, the Italian
tongue (which, next the Greek and Latin tongue, I like
and love above all other); or else because I do despise the
learning that is gotten, or the experience that is gathered
- in strange countries3 or for any private malice, that I
bear to Italy3 which country, and in it, namely, Rome, I
have always specially honoured: because time was, when
Italy and Rome have been to the great good of us that ·
now live ...... But now that time is gone.''—Ibid., pp.
72, 73.
