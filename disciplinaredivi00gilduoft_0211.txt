monium LANGUAGES ΛΝΒ TRAVEL. 191

An intelligent and well-read man, though not a
classical scholar, may still be possessed of sufficient
historical knowledge to enable him to appreciate
much that he will meet with in a tour in Italy 3
but the peculiar charm which such opportunities
yield to the lover of Horace and Livy is a delight
denied to all else. For these, the student will
take care to fit himself with no stinted measure of
preparation.

Travel amid regions of classical association
doubtless imposes the yoke of connection between
the literature of that period, which we have before
shown to be essentially and plainly marked as
ancient, and that which, under the title of mo-
dem, comprises events and vicissitudes in human
affairs of no less wonderful significance in the his-
tory of the world. Rome may be looked upon,
we believe, as an uncomfortable and decidedly
dirty place, where human nature, as it prevails
amongst ourselves, is subject to many petty an-
nnyances, from which we, in virtue perhaps of our
fogs, are exempt3 or it may be regarded as the
city where the iron heel of conquest has left its
deepest prints, “ which, as it was once the Em-
press of the world in a succession of many ages, so
hath it at present more curious things to entertain
the attention of a traveller than any other place in
Europe.”*
