hard-won summer holidays l—how full art thou of
bright associations to this dull February hrain,—
how big with J uly promises of freedom and of
mountain air and—silence, which no petulant
“ quarter-bell ” can vex or startle !

Or does our reader think that there are no as-
sociations in these islands which will bear com-
parison‚ for interest, with those of other lands?
Oh, reader, fie upon thee! thou knowest not thine
own beart, and the dark films of fancy cloud thy
clear eye‚—-learn ‘⁶ the art of seeing'’ as thou
wouldst any other art, and thy own village will be
tenfold dearer to thee3 dip for half an hour into
the pages of “ Our Village‚’' or of De Quincey’s
“ Autobiographic Sketches,'’ ³¹⁵ or ‘⁶ The Doctor‚”
or of William Wordsworth‚ and thou shalt see-—

pastoral recesses . . . —these were so many local spells
upon me, equally poetic and elevating with the Miltonic
names of Valdarno and Vallombrosa.”-Vol. i. p. 228.
