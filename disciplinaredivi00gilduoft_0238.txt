As to prescriptions on the subject of travel‚ it
will be easy for the reader to gather many hints
for himself out of books. We particularly recom-
mend the perusal of Bacon's “Essay on Travel ;’'
Mr. Helps's chapters (ix. and xi.) on the same
subject in “Companions of my Solitude‚” a treatise
full of that practical wisdom and of that philo-
sophical spirit which the writer has so often con-
tributed to the clearing up of men's misconceptions,
and the enhancing of the unappreciated blessings
of life; Eustace's ‘⁴ Classical Tour in Italy‚'’ as a

specimen of a fine old scholarlike style, and as a

really valuable to the student3 Burnet's “LetterS‚
containing an account of what seemed most re-
markable in travelliny through Switzerland‚ Italy,
some parts of Germany, ὄπα, in the Years 1685
and 1686 ;” Sir F. Palgrave's “Merchant and
Friar.’'

These notices of books we do not attempt to
multiply, only for the reason that they might be
multiplied indefinitely.

Our object will have been attained, if we pre-
vail upon any of our readers to take up the more
vigorous study of modern languages, or to look
upon travel with a more intelligent anticipation of
its fruits. The present period of the year is one
which might fairly be given to preparation of the
