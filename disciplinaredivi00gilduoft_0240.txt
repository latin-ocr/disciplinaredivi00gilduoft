CHAPTER XI.

SOME REMARKS ΟΝ THE GULTIVATION
OF TASTE.

“ The most important clement in the Beautiful is the
moral idea . . . consequently, the most important element
in taste, and in genius, is the sentiment of moral beauty.''
—V. Cousin.

Ε are not unaware of the difficulties which

must attend even a superficial review of

the subject before us. It is one involving deep
philosophical considerations‚ whilst there are
scarcely any limits to the variety and multitude of
the topics which it embraces. To omit all men-
tion of taste, however, in a volume devoted to the
main features of a liberal education, would be to
shut our eyes to the influence of beauty upon the
human mind, or at least to confess ourselves un-
able to estimate its legitimate weight. Our design
is not to give anything like a rationale of the sub-
ject, or to enter upon a systematic discussion of its
several parts. We cannot even hope to put for-
ward anything like a complete arx-ay of induce-
ments to the study of the beautiful and the culti-
vation of the imaginative faculty. This would
require a knowledge of art and a degree of taste
and philosophioal acumen to which we lay no claim ;
