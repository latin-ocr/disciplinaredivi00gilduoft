stages of its growth are distinctly observable to
that in which such symptoms are scarcely trace-
able. Whether the former of these conditions be
only a faltering and abnormal exhibition of that
which is seen in its true character only in the
genius of intuition, is an interesting question, but
it does not affect the assumption, that taste is ca-
pable of cultivation and refinement.

In claiming for taste a connection with the ac-
tive exercise of intellect, we separate it off sharply
from dilettaoztez’sm, and from that desultory state
which would enfeeble the mind and lay the subject
of taste open to grave moral objections. It is in
virtue, therefore, of its strict amenability to the
rules which apply to other studies, that we claim
for it a distinct disciplinal value.

The refinement of the critical faculty is doubt-
less the result of a combination of influences. The
power of interpreting impressions produced upon
the senses by the contemplation of external objects,
in a language intelligible to the mind itself, is not
a simple matter.* Before proper discipline has

realization of a great action or stirring incident, which
alone enables one mind to imprint its own impressions in
sharp and vigorous outline on another.'’—Article on “ Poetry
