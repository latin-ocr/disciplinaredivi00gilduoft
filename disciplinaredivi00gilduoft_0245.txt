CULTIVATION OF TASTE. 225

been exerted, the balance necessary to‘ be estab-
lished between the operation of the senses and of
the mind is imperfect. The mind is liable to be
imposed upon until its jurisdiction is fairly estab-
lished. When the judgment too readily assents
to the appeal of the senses, the result is commonly
an undue arrogation of authority, without anything
like ground for such confidence. The man of
confident, as well as hasty judgment‚ in matters of
taste‚ is little likely to succeed in the attempt
really to cultivate and refine his powers.

We contend that there must be a patient and
unassuming spirit of beginning at the beginning, in
this as in every other matter appertaining to edu-
cation. The critical faculty in man is one which
requires most time to mature, and will least of all
bear to be precipitated into maturity, inasmuch as
it is the business of this faculty to pronounce, as
well as to form, judgments on matters of taste.
There may well be a certain deliberativeness and
hesitancy about the development of powers so
large, and which require so little encouragement.
Time and pains bestowed upon the several degrees
in their attainment will, after all, seem ‚to be most
valuably bestowed.

The habit of accurate observation‚ then, will lie
at the foundation of that growth of the critical
faculty, which we have described as complex in
its nature. How does the critical faculty develop
itself out of this origin, and where does the com-
plexity in its character begin?
