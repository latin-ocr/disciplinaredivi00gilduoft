mind—few who can, in the words of an old friend’s
Latin prize poem at Oxford,—

‘⁶ Multiplicem rerum cognoscere simplicitatem.'’

But just in proportion as the study increases in
difficulty does it furnish ground for the legitimate
discipline of the higher mental faculties. It is to
be observed, that we have in some measure sub-
jected the domain of imagination to the jurisdiction
of intellect 3 by which we do not mean that the
poet or the painter is to proceed upon the idea
that his fancy must wear the bridle and the bit of
the logical regimem* but only that the student, in
dealing with the works of poet, or painter, or mu-
sician, may bring a severe and well-accredited test
to bear upon them. Nor, again, would we be un-
derstood to mean that a high condition of the
critical faculty is all that is needful to the critic
of taste, but only, indeed, that, with all his other
qualifications, he must be a man of practised logical
acumen, exercised in nice distinctions, and skiHed
in the difficult process of simplifying and discerning
the proportionate value of the subject-matter of
his studies, This is the view of the matter which
commends itself to our present consideration, and
we think we have said enough to show that those
studies which contribute to the cultivation of the
taste are neither in themselves dangerous nor cal-
culated to enfeeble the intellect of the student ;
