and in all cases most desirable as a check upon
the imagination.

And here we may be permitted to call attention
to a tendency, in the poetry of the day, to disregard
those considerations, which we would thus associate
with works of the imagination ; that is, a tendency
to carelessness and to a neglect of the fixed rules
of art, as well as to downright slovenliness of exe-
cution.* By fixed rules, we mean those require-
ments, of choice as to subject, and as to care in
carrying out such definite aim, which cannot be
regarded as arbitrary 3 such conditions‚ for ex-
ample, as answer to the choice of subject and
propriety of treatment in the painter‚ and which
cannot be violated without manifest disregard of
the principles of art.† Perhaps the most con-
vincing evidence of the faults to which we allude,

³ “ Vos, ὂ
Pompilius sanguis, carmen reprehendite, quod non
Multa dies et multa litura coercuit, atque
Perfectum decies non castigavit ad unguem.”
Ib. 291—295.

Horace heard and answered :—
“ Pictor-ibus atque Poe'tis
Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.
Scimus, et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim ε
Sed non ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut,” &c-
I b. 9- 12.
“ Sed in vitium libertas excidit, et vim
Dignam lege regi: lex est accepta.''—Ib. 282—284.
