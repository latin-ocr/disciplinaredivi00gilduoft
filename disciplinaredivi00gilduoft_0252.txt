of music which, we are assured, would yield the
most abundant return to the student. This con-

or grammar of the science, which we have spoken
of as characteristic of all study which is designed
to elevate the critical faculty. It consists in an
analysis of harmony, which is, to the scholar in
music, what the study of the axioms and postulates
of geometry is to one just opening Euclid, or the
scheme of opposition to one commencing logia*

makes him great in his work, we shall see presently.
But speaking merely of the external appliances of
art, the great painter will almost certainly be a
man of great natural genius for form, or colour, or

science with the most remarkable succeSS, and to whom
the knowledge thus acquired has proved an invaluable re-
source, as enabling him to give correct and ready ex·
pression to his own conceptions in music.
