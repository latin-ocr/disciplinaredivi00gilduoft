236 DISCIPLINA REDIVIVA.

and painters who have no taste or sense of beauty: in
some there is no such element as imagination3 in
others this faculty is powerful, but undisciplined.
What noble intellectual ruins attest the worth of
discipline and the cost at which it is slighted!*
How many have the command of almost indefinite
natural resources--how few have that element of
genius which consists in perseverance!

A great principle of beauty and interest is con-
veyed in the ancient paradox, πλέον ἥμισυ vav-sogd-

'‘ “ Vis consili expers mole ruit suff—Hor. Od.
† The following lines, by an Oxford friend, suggested
some of the thoughts which follow.

“ Νὴπιοι οὐκ ἴσασιν ὅσῳ πλέον ἥμισυ παντός.”
“ Knowest not how far the half exceeds the whole ?''
Oh! mystic words of old the poet sung :—
Strange words, ill welcome to the selfish sou13
Yet from profoundest‚ holiest lore they sprung,
And thoughts beyond the reach of mortal tongue:
Yet true,—ay wondrous true their deep intent,
Even from the cold frail heart winning no feign’d assent.

“ Half more than all !'' Oh ! hast thou never stood
Alone at eve on some high mountain orest,

And gazing fondly o'er the empurpled flood,
Where sank the fiery monarch of the west,
Hast thou not felt how narrow thy poor breast,

And long'd to bid some kindred spirit share

The glories too divine for thee alone to bear ?

Or lived great spirit ever, heaven-taught,

Who, framing some grand image in his heart,
Endured to keep untold the o'erwhelming thought,
ι Nor strove his dear won treasure to impart

Through sculptor’s, painter’s, or through poet's art?
Oh! mighty thoughts, like mighty joy or grief,
Burst the o'erburden'd sou] that finds not such relief.
