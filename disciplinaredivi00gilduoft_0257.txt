CULTIVATION 010* TAs'rE. 237

The imagery of poets and painters of the higher
class will be found to embody it, and is worthy of

“ Half more than all !'’ Oh! did'st thou never note
How lovelier far than noonday's brightest gleam
The fairy shades at morn or eve that float ’.Ρ
And is not aye the poet's fondest theme
The bud half-blown, and crescent Cynthia's beam?
Add not to beauty's char-ms a double grace [face.
The jealous looks that screen some blushing maiden's

Or say, fond beart, when earth can yield no more
The mortal half of one who own'd thy love,
Clings not affection closer than before
To the undying spirit stored above ’Β
The gloomiest hour the dawn of bliss may prove.
No ill to man without its good is given 3
And years of woe on earth may win a life in Heaven.

“ Half more than all ! '³ Nay ! ask the gentle Bride,
Ask the true heart that claims her for his own,

If e'er they sail’d o'er love’s pure boundless tide,
If e'er the depths of joy and peace were known,
Till self forgat to live as self alone,

And sharing the deep treasures of the breast,

Found by the generous gift itself how doubly bless'd.

Smooth words :—Yet hard, sweet sister, 'tis to learn
How I should gain by losing half thy care3

By missing thy bright face at each return,
And thinking, “ Oh! my — — wert thou there
In converse sweet to take thy wonted share,—

To all my schemes and tales, each hope or fear,

Ready to lend a woman's and a sister's ear.'’

 

Yet idly wisdom's warnings have I heard
1f I refuse to heed the sage old bard,

Nor treasure in my heart that golden word,—
“ Too fond desires—Oh! Lesson kind though hard,—
Mortal, restrain: thy loss is thy reward:

For, long as earth's imperfect ages roll,

For feeble human hearts the half excels the whole.''
