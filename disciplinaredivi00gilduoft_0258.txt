is 311 example of that power of genius which con-
sists in the ability to refrain from a perfect deli-
neation, and to leave to imagination just that half
of the picture on which it will dwell with most
delight. This unexpressed, but implied world of
beauty, is that in which the poet himself, and all
who share in his creative genius, find the most
varied occupatiori of their fancy and thought. It
is a legitimate and graceful application of the
omne iynotum pro maqm'fico,—a principle which
goes far to interpret man’s awe of the mysterious
beauty of nature. In the lines which we have just
quoted there is room left, in the suppressed mem-
ber of the comparison‚ for an array of beautiful
images, each varying with the mind and imagina-
tion and poetic power of the reader. Indeed, this
is an example of what we often find ourselves
compelled to confess, in translating poets into
another language, viz.‚ that poet alone can wor—
thily render poet, that one stanza of Horace would
sometimes tax the genius of Coleridge, and Words-
worth, and Byron‚ could we summon them to the
reseue; e. y. this,—
