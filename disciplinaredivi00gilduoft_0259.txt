Here is a perfect picture sketched by the poet

the English words to express it! These may be
found in the like pictures of our own true poetS,
but they are coy of showing themselves to a trans-
lator. Mr. Tennyson’s “Brook” may help us ;
but Horace's “winds about, and in and out,'’
within the compass of six words. By the way, it
would be excellent practice to follow out some of
these undesigned coincidences of poetic delinea-

creates.'’—Prqf. Reed on Byron's description of Lake Leman.

We venture to add from Pindar—

“ Ἀστὴρ ἀρίζηλος, ἀληθινὸν
Ἀνδρὶ φέγγος.”
