it reveres it, aspires to this ideal, which it detaches
as much as possible from nature 3 it etherealizes
the forms of matter, and takes away all that can
obstruet the idea. Taste reposes tranquilly in the
contemplation of the beautiful in nature; genius
rends and re-constructs nature, in order to make it
more like the idea ..... Genius destroys nature
while it reveres it, and then restores it more pure
and more like the moral idea graven upon it by
the hand of God ; thus the marks of genius are
destruction and creation ..... Thus the artist
who, seriously regarding nature, should be satisfied
to copy it faithfully, would fall from the rank of
an artist, to that of a mechanic. I see that this
portrait very exactly represents such a person, but
there is no ideal there, the work is not by an
artist. This decision condemns the whole school
of painting‚ of sculpture, or of music, which does
not conceive of nature as symbolic‚ and which
does not consecrate art to the discovery of symbols,
the most pure and the most expressive of moral
ideas. If art has for its great purpose the pic-
turing forth of moral beauty, the result is that it
excites in other minds the sentiment of the beau-
tiful which the artist possessesss'*

Such is Victor Cousin’s view of the difference
between taste and genius, and of the true end of
art. We may go on to say that nature is in one
