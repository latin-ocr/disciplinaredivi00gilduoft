attentively what strikes you in this master-picce.
Winkelmann—who was not a metaphysician, but
an artist, who was gifted with the highest genius,
and who understood the procedure of art—Wink-
elmann has made an analysis of the Apollo. It
is interesting to study this analysis, and perceive
by it how physicalis blended with spiritual beauty.
That which first of all struck Winkelmann was
the character of nobleneSS, pride, and divinity im-
pressed upon every line of the statue. The fore-
head is that of Jove, whence sprang the goddess
of wisdom ; it is unchangeably calm: indignation
swells the nostrils; scorn rests upon the lips; the
attitude of the body, the arms and feet, all proclaim
the vanquisher of Python. The tranquil and dis-
dainful joy felt in triumphing over a contemptible
enemy, the delight of victory, the slight effort that
victory has cost,—these shone forth upon the eyes
of Winkelmann from the glorious statue. The
analysis of this artist is a hymn to spiritual beauty,
but, strange to say, he has not perceived it3 he
has not Seen that all that beauty, whose traits he
has collected with such affection, is but the mani-
festation of an internal beauty, that it was incor-
poreal beauty which shone through its veil ; in a
word, that the beauty of the Apollo Belvidere can
be summed up in the word Expression.

‘⁶ Let us pass now from a cold and inanimate
statue to a living, real man. We shall find that
the physica] can be beautiful only on the condition
that it be subservient to moral beauty ..... it
