is not the outline of matter, in regard to pure
surface·and form, that receives the impress of
sublimity; it is matter vivid, alive, that is, ex-
pressive matter, matter exhibiting mind throwing
aside its enshrouding veil.”

For the value of the contrast between the ex-
pression of two of the high arts in relation to the
same ideal, we quote Byron’s lines on the Apollo—

“ Or view the lord of the unerring bow,

The god of life, and poesy, and light 3

The sun in human limbs array'd, and brow

All radiant from his triumph in the fight3

The shaft hath just been shot—the arrow bright
With an immortal's vengeance3 in his eye

And nostril beautiful disdain, and might,

And majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
Developing, in that one glauce, the deity.

“ But in his delicate form—a dream of love,
Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast
Long’d for a deathless lover from above,

And madden'd in that vision—are express’d

All that ideal beauty ever bless'd,
The mind within it most unearthl y mood,

When each conception was a heavenly guest—

A ray of immortality3 and stood,

Starlike, around, until they gather’d to a god! ''
Childe Harold, canto iv.

For the same contrast in relation to painting
and poetry‚ take Mrs. Sigourney's noble descrip-
tion of Leonardo da Vinci's “ Last Supper.'’

Again‚ compare with the famous statue of
“The Dying Gladiator‚” Byron's picture of the
same incident, as drawn in the following ‘⁶ won-
drous words of simple English :'’—-
