“ 1 see before me the gladiator lie ε

He leans upon his hand—his manly brow

Consents to death, but conquers agony,

And his droop'd head sinks gradually low-—

And through his side the last drops, ebbing slo'w

From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,

Were with his heart, and that was far away3

But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
There were his young barbarians all at play,
There was their Dacian mother—heg their sire,
Butoher'd to make a Roman holiday—

All this rush'd with his blood—shall he expire,

And unavenged ¹? Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire !'’
Childe Harold, canto iv.
