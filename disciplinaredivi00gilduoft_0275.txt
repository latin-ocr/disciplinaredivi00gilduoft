truths of man's whole nature. The tendency of ι
this study is to soften the moral sense and to re-
fine the judgment‚ at the same time that the seve-
rity of the discipline is maintained through the
abstract nature of its investigations. The result
of the study is to give men a juster appreciation of
the phenomena of human action, and a more patient
temper in dealing with the problems of human
government and happiness⁴

In suggesting a course of sacred study, we have
had in mind the conviction of a general tendency
to undervalue precision of aim and accurate re-
search in relation to religious knowledge, In this,
more than in the province of secular learning, the
prevailing habit of men's minds is desultory and
inexact.

We have shown that the actual study of the-
Bible in Greek or Hebrew would go far towards
remedying this defect in the case of the young.
But it may not be out of place to attempt to trace
the ground of the defect in question to a deeper
source. This deeper source appears to us to be
the common view which men take of the question
of worldly vocations in general. It is too much
the practice to regard secular professions as in-
volving some desecration in idea, as distinct from
a life whose vocation is the sphere of spiritual
ministration. Men's intellectual energies are so
much accustomed to be devoted exclusively to the
subject matter of their individual callings, that
they fail to bring to the study of sacred subjects
