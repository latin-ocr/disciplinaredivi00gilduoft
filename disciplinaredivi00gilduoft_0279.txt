equably develop—certain faculties, those which
the daily business of life may call into play, may
become highly exercised., but all hope of largeness
of mind is gone. The only means by which this
can be attained is a progressive training of the
mind, and that healthful exercise which the
analogy of the body during the same period so
clearly teaches. By such voluntary exerfion, what
is valuable in school habits is separated from what
is only accidental: the scheme of progress natu-
rally adapts itself to new powers and new interests
in the student. He feels the influence of method
without the oppression of its weight, he loses the
marks of the harness, but not the inward impress
of the training; art has done its work in becoming
habit, graceful, free, and vigorous action of mind.
On the other hand, in the case of the youth, who
gives up habits of study to assume those manners
which he unhappily conceives to belong to the
next stage of life, we have no mental advance3
the man is intellectually little more than the
overgrown boy, and the awkwardnesses and mis-
takes of school are reproduced, only with this
ffifference, that they appear on a larger and more

obtrusive scale.
Of the direct religious value of intellectual dis-

cipline we have spoken, but we do not enlarge
upon a topic the importance of which we would
imply, rather than attempt to exhibit in the im-
perfect proportions to which a limited space would
oblige us.
