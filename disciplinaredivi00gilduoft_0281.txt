coNcLumNG REMARKS. 261

connection with that just quoted, has been con-
stantly present with us in the working out of our
scheme, and now brings it to a close.

“ Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away:
yea‚ she is easily seen of them that love her, and
found of such as seek her. She preventeth them
that desire her, in making herself first known unto
them. Whoso seeketh her early shall have no
great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his
doors. To think upon her is perfection of wisdom :
and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be with-
out care. For she goeth about secking such as
are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto
them in the ways, and meeteth them in every
thought. For the very true beginning of her is
the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline
is love3 and love is the keeping of her laws3 and
the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of
incorruptione and incorruption maketh us near
unto God : therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth
to a kingdom.”
