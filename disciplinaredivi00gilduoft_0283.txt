APPENDIX A.

On the University Sys-tem qf Education.

N referring to Dr. Donaldson's Essay “ on Classi-
cal Scholarship and Classical Learning‚'’ we have
directed the student to a source of information as to
the character of the classical education pursued at
Cambridge.

We intended to present some passages from the
Report of the University commission contained in
the two Blue Books‚ published in 1852 3 but we must
be content to direct the attention of the curicus to
the very interesting rationale of University education‚
(involving an incidental review of the general princi-
ples of a liberal education)‚ contained in the evidence
furnished by either University.

Take as a single example, the following, as bearing
upon the subject of classical studies.

“ Now the end of all education appears to me to be
two-fold; firstly, to strengthen the intellect sor the
acquisition of knowledge3 secondly‚ to furnish the
mind with knowledge it-self.

“ Of these two obj ects, the first is more properly the
object of University teacffing, and the means appli-
cable to carrying it out constitute ‘ education,’ in the
strict sense of the term3 for the acquisition of know-
ledge is the result of education‚ rather than education
itselfi and bears the same relation to it that reading a
book does to learning the alphabet.
