APPENDIX. 271

Universities; but the simple fact is, that Greek and
Latin are better instruments for the purpose than any
others which could be selected. The mind could not
be as well disciplined by the study of Dutch and
Portuguese ξιε it is by that of the classics. A good
classical scholar might reckon with confidence upon
being able to master any other language to which his
attention might be turned, and a good general edu-
cation would fit a man for the diversified range of
public duty more successfully than any special train-
ing, which, while conferring certain faciliffies, might
leave the broad energies of the mind less effectually
developed ..... Α knowledge of classics, or history,
or the exact sciences is pretty sure to prove valuable ;
in fact, it represents the fruit of that liberal education
which is one of the best introductions to the contests
of life.’'—Time.s·‚ Oct. 1502, 1855.
